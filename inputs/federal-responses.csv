scott-morrow,"1767 Truman in Laramie.  3 years.  15 years.  Birthplace; Denver, CO",70,"Scott is an accomplished MMA artist who was a single parent of five children.  A strong advocate of workers since 1978, as an EEOC, MSPB, unemployment hearings, SSDI appeals, ADA rep, President of the ninth largest local American Postal Workers Union (APWU) in the nation and later the Director of Industrial Relations.  Currently serves as the President of the Denver Metro Retiree Chapter chartered by APWU.  The chapter has members all over the country, including Wyoming.  In his pro bono occupations, literally hundreds of calls, letters and emails have been made to Senator Barrasso's office to advocate for his current constituents.  This Senator votes 100% of the time against workers, unions, women, equality, democracy and the poor.  That is why I was compelled to run.","First of all, we need all of our congressional delegation from Wyoming to adhere to the principles of the ""equality"" state.  Codifying the fantastic principles of decency and fairness to all, including women, in the same manner as the Great State of Wyoming should be a top priority.  Women should have equal health care opportunities, equal pay at work,  equal employment and business opportunities, etc.  Therefore, the Equal Rights amendment consistently voted against by our current federal delegation must be a priority to get passed.    Making Medicaid expansion more palatable for legislatures like Wyoming is mandatory to insure all people including children have access to health care in Wyoming.   I fully support and would co-sponsor S-597, HR 82, HR 1447, HR 5569, HR 5601, HR 6992, and HR 884, when they have sister bills in the US Senate. Any legislation to adhere to Matthew 25, 41-46 will be a priority for me.
","I don't.  The current BLM administration is transparent, efficient and protects OUR lands from greedy monopolies and politicians.","1.  Pass Medicaid expansion.  
2.  Instead of putting a billion dollars in a rainy day fund, provide relief for first time home buyers. 
3.  Pay teachers properly and allow greater access to teacher unions.  STOP banning books.  Greater supplementation of UW to lower tuition costs.  
4.  Starting with Family Farmers and Ranchers, provide them the desperate help they need.  Restrict the percentage of factory farms.
5.  Accept federal funds paid for by Wyoming tax payers to feed children a nutritious school lunch in lieu of arbitrarily passing on this program.  Lower-income families with school-age kids can get help from the federal government paying for groceries this summer, unless they live in Wyoming.  Increase the minimum wage!","Very.  I need to know what the electorate in Wyoming expects from their Senator and to represent accordingly, even when I may disagree.  As an election worker in Wyoming, it was imperative to work with my colleagues from across the isle.  In 2010 this was a pleasant learning experience for me.  In 2022 it became much more of a challenge.",This is really a non issue.  I just have not seen many immigrants around here and the folks I have seen where the ones who would work on a hot roof when no one else wanted to.,"Absolutely NOT.  Any such support would put me at odds with the people of Wyoming's constitution in article one, section 38.  Women's reproductive health care is health care and no one, especially federal reps should be or legally can be,  getting between women and their doctors in family planning.  I support codifying the principles in Roe V Wade.",For the most part that balance has already been achieved.  The balance is tipped a bit by allowing monopolies who egregiously pollute our air and water to run rampant over our lands.
kyle-cameron,I currently live in Laramie Wyoming and I have lived here for about a year and a half.  I was born in Wyoming and have lived here off and on for my entire life.,63,"I'm an activist with public service in my DNA, currently enjoying work at an international company. In Wyoming, I keep my job private due to the tricky mix of work and politics. As Chair of the Wyoming Democratic Labor Caucus, I'm dedicated to supporting workers and unions. Raised in Cheyenne, I attended Goins Elementary, Johnson Junior High, and Central High School, then earned degrees from the University of Wyoming, Colorado State University, and Walden University. Homeschooling my kids for 15 years was a rewarding challenge. Overcoming obstacles as a stay-at-home mom reentering the workforce, I've been supported by systems aiding women escaping domestic abuse. My career has ranged from 2010 Census taker to grant writing, learning from each role. Volunteering, from leading a 4-H group to labor caucus chair, has been a key part of my life, reflecting my commitment to causes I cherish.","As a federal lawmaker, my priorities for Wyoming include advocating for reproductive rights, universal healthcare access, worker protections, improved transportation infrastructure, and climate change action. I'll push for legislation ensuring access to reproductive health services, including safe abortion and contraceptives. Healthcare legislation will aim for affordability and inclusivity, covering mental and dental health, and focusing on preventive care. I'll work to strengthen worker rights, ensuring safe, fair conditions and support for those facing workplace challenges. Investing in Wyoming's transportation infrastructure is key for economic growth and quality of life, requiring federal funding for roads, bridges, and railroads. Addressing climate change is critical, with efforts towards sustainable water management and reducing emissions to protect our environment and ensure community resilience. These efforts aim to create a more equitable, sustainable Wyoming.","I'll prioritize collaborative management of Wyoming's federal lands, ensuring they serve the state's ecological, economic, and recreational needs. Recognizing the importance of these lands to Wyoming's identity and economy, I'll advocate for policies that balance conservation with responsible development. This includes supporting sustainable practices in energy production, agriculture, and tourism, while also protecting natural habitats and biodiversity. Engaging local communities, Indigenous tribes, and stakeholders in decision-making processes will be key to understanding diverse perspectives and needs. I'll push for increased federal investment in land management for conservation, wildfire prevention, and infrastructure improvements, ensuring access and enjoyment for future generations. By promoting science-based management practices, I aim to address climate change impacts and preserve Wyoming's natural beauty and resources, ensuring they remain a source of pride and prosperity.","Wyoming should actively support its citizens' well-being by investing in affordable housing, accessible healthcare, quality education, and sustainable economic development. The state should facilitate partnerships and funding to expand housing options, ensuring affordability for all income levels. In healthcare, Wyoming must work to remove barriers to access, including expanding services in rural areas and supporting mental and dental health. Education should be a priority, with investments in schools and programs that prepare students for future success. Economic development efforts should focus on diversifying the economy, promoting job creation in emerging sectors, and supporting small businesses. By prioritizing these areas, Wyoming can create a strong foundation for the well-being and prosperity of its citizens and their families, ensuring a vibrant future for the state.","I am generally open to compromise with legislators and officials who hold different perspectives, provided discussions remain rational and respectful. However, I hold firm on my belief in a woman's right to a legal and safe abortion, which I see as non-negotiable. It's crucial to engage in clear discourse without feeling threatened or intimidated to find common ground on other issues.","Immigration impacts Wyoming by contributing to its economy through labor in agriculture, energy, and tourism sectors. It also enriches cultural diversity and helps address workforce shortages. Congress can improve immigration policy for Wyoming by implementing reforms such as: Creating visa programs tailored to Wyoming's specific labor shortages in agriculture, energy extraction, and hospitality.  Establishing clear paths to legal status for undocumented immigrants already contributing to Wyoming's economy. Streamlining processes to reunite families, supporting stable communities. Enhancing border security while ensuring efficient processes for legal immigration. Investing in programs that facilitate immigrants' integration, including language and job training. By addressing these aspects, Congress can create policies that benefit Wyoming citizens by supporting its economy and communities while respecting immigrant contributions and the rule of law.","I strongly support federal legislation that upholds the right to legal and safe abortions. Ensuring access to abortion services is crucial for women's health, autonomy, and equality. Restricting access jeopardizes reproductive rights and can lead to unsafe practices. Federal legislation should protect these rights nationwide, ensuring consistency and equity regardless of state laws. Similarly, access to contraceptives is essential for reproductive health and family planning. Federal policies should guarantee affordable and widespread availability of contraceptives, including education on their use. This supports individual choice, reduces unintended pregnancies, and promotes overall public health. In summary, I advocate for federal legislation that protects and expands access to both abortions and contraceptives, affirming individuals' rights to make informed decisions about their reproductive health.","Balancing wildlife preservation and open spaces with energy, industrial, and real estate development in Wyoming demands careful planning. Establishing protected areas and wildlife corridors preserves native habitats through zoning laws and conservation easements. Promoting sustainable energy like wind and solar supports growth while minimizing environmental impact. Engaging stakeholders—environmentalists, developers, indigenous communities, and government—ensures collaboration and diverse perspectives. Enforcing regulations with impact assessments ensures development meets environmental standards. Integrating conservation and responsible development sustains Wyoming's natural heritage and economic vitality."

I am an Eagle Scout and a member of the Christian Legal Society since law school. I obtained the first double-digit firm fixed-price contract in the history of the Hughes Aircraft Company; and I was the head of the team to redesign the fire control system of the Army's main battle tank, the M60A3. 
My grandmother met my grandfather in Gillette in 1919 and her brothers had the livery stable. 
I was one of the youngest judges in Wyoming history and helped establish the Circuit Court system of today. I was president of my college fraternity.
I was instrumental in placing the carrying of concealed weapon without a permit for Wyoming residents on the Wyoming Republican platform in 2010.  
I was class president at Clark Air Base in the Philippines, where the Japanese first developed kamikaze tactics as a mass weapon of war.  I was on the Bataan Death March 20th anniversary march with three of the original survivors and received the historic trail award.

 "," Government is best that governs least. I will strengthen America's defense and reduce the deficit. I would make Social Security non-taxable once again.  I would export our resources to Europe and Israel through the Straits of Gibraltar to broaden our opportunities.  Wyoming is an energy treasure trove in an energy short world.  Our natural resources should help our friends, not our enemies.

 "," We must follow the Constitution.  I would introduce novel concepts, coupled with the courage to do what it takes to solve the problems of America today.  I am willing to risk my career to do the right thing. More and more will result in less and less.  We must have the courage to stop hyperinflation.

steven-helling,"Casper, 2 and-a-half years now, 16 and-half years earlier, for a total of 19 years in Casper and 26 years in Wyoming.  I was born on an air force base in Japan.",70,"I am an attorney, presently practicing law on a  part-time basis.  I have resolved hundreds of disputes and interpreted dozens of laws.  I have been on boards and commissions, including six years on an independent ethics commission and nine years on the board of a legal organization providing services to the poor.   I was chairman of the board of ethics commission for over a year and president of the board of the organization providing service to the poor for two years,.","We need to emphasize the use of fossil fuels and eliminate any new construction of nuclear power plants until after there is a permanent site for nuclear waste.  I would propose a national moratorium on new nuclear construction, while also working behind the scenes with Wyoming legislators, seeking to make Wyoming the 13th state with a state moratorium, prohibiting the construction of new nuclear power plants until after there is a permanent site for nuclear waste.   Fossil fuels are becoming more and more efficient and clean, with new technologies, such as carbon capturing, making the use of fossil fuels more and more desirable.  Joe Biden, who I think is the worst and most anti-American president ever, wants rapid expansion of civil nuclear power in the United States. He cannot and should not be trusted.  Wyoming must not be a party to the internal nuclear poisoning.  ","The appointment of good people to manage federal lands is critical.  Investing in landscape preservation, instead of nuclear energy, along with good management of the lands, creates natural carbon storage and maintains  and protects our clean water.  We all enjoy the benefits of clean air and water.   Good management also benefits wildlife and their habitats.","Wyoming should assist families to only a limited degree, while requiring all able-bodied men to work as part of any assistance program.   One exception where expansion would make sense is for mental health services.  Mental health issues appear rampant and contribute to other issues affecting the well being of citizens and their families. 
Living with the fear of radiation exposure will increase if Kemmerer has a nuclear power plant.  The experimental nuclear plant proposed for Kemmerer has a life expectancy of 60 years.  The environment minister in Germany, which shut down its last nuclear reactor in 2023, has stated 3 generations of Germans benefited from nuclear power and now about 30,000 generations would be faced with dealing with the radioactive nuclear waste.  Wyoming would be well supporting its citizens if it were to pass a statewide moratorium against new construction of nuclear power plants until there was first a permanent storage site for highly radioactive nuclear waste. ","My willingness to compromise is dependent on the issue.  As stated above, I have resolved hundreds of disputes and resolution of disputes generally requires compromise.  On the other hand, burdening Wyoming for hundreds and thousands of years with nuclear waste, with no permanent site for the storage of nuclear waste, would not be something I would likely compromise on.  The federal government has promised a permanent nuclear waste site for at least 60 years and there are no foreseeable plans to provide a permanent storage site.  No one wants it.  Nuclear is not needed and most climate change advocates do not want nuclear power, which they know is fraught with danger and is not environmentally sustainable, in addition to being very expensive.  Wyoming must not trust Joe Biden with its future.  If Wyoming is willing to burden hundreds of future generations with the problem of dealing with nuclear waste, we should all hang our heads in shame. ","We need the remain in Mexico policy to be in place.  We need to enforce our current immigration laws.  We should close our border and reverse Joe Biden's open border policy.  A country without borders will not be a country for long, as terrorists and criminals are included in the persons illegally entering this country.  ",I would support federal legislation restricting abortions.  I think it is necessary to slow down the slaughter of unborn children.  I oppose any contraceptives that kill a baby after conception but approve of contraceptives that prevent fertilization of the mother's egg.,"This needs to be addressed on a case-by-case basis.  I think ""balance"" is the key, as developing our fossil fuels is essential to the economy of Wyoming.  In addition, tourism, hunting,  fishing, and outdoor activities are also essential to Wyoming's economy.  We have clean air and clean water.  We have pristine areas that must be protected.  We have a wonderful life living in Wyoming and we must not put it all at risk by allowing the construction of an experimental nuclear power plant in Kemmerer.  We must not let our greed for money put the safety of future generations at risk, likely for thousands and thousands of years.  Jesus was walking on this planet about 2,000 years ago.  I think he would want us to protect our planet and to love our neighbors.  We must not trust Joe Biden and we must ""fight like Helling"" against the construction of an experimental nuclear power plant in Kemmerer. "
