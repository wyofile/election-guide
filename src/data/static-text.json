    {
      "question":"WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PRIMARY AND GENERAL ELECTION?",
      "answer":"Voters affiliated with a major party — Democratic or Republican — vote in the primary election to determine which nominees advance to the general election. Because Wyoming has a closed partisan primary, only voters registered with a major party can vote for candidates in partisan races. For the 2024 election, the deadline for registered voters to change party affiliation was May 15. In the primary election, unaffiliated voters or minor-party-affiliated voters can still vote, but their ballot only includes non-partisan races, like those for municipal offices.\n\nEligible voters who are not yet registered — including those purged from the voter rolls for lack of recent participation — can do so, and select a party affiliation, at their polling place on the primary or general election day. \n\nAll registered voters — regardless of party affiliation — can vote in the general election for candidates to fill offices at the federal, state and local levels. General election voters also get to decide on ballot initiatives and whether to retain judges."
