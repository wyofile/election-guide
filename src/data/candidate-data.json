Inflation is nationwide and in addition to that our core industries of coal, oil, and gas are being choked by the Biden administration’s permitting games.   Coal, oil, gas, trona, tourism, and agriculture have historically supported Wyoming citizens and the State of Wyoming budget.   We are also getting market pressure from consumers who, for reasons many of us can’t relate to, have carbon on their minds.  Every policy the legislature crafts must take these industries into consideration.  Anytime we can support these industries, we must.  Any policy that puts more pressure on our proven industries is unwise.\r\n",

      "I was born and raised in Wheatland, Wyoming. After high school I got a degree in power-plant technologies. Out of school I took a job as a diesel Mechanic, predominantly working on class 8 diesels, and I did this for 4 years. I then took a job at LRS, a coal fire power plant, in Wheatland as a mechanic welder for 8 years. Following that, I took a turn in my career path and became a pastor of a local church. I have been in that role now for 9 years. During that time, I was also the chairman of the Platte County Chamber of Commerce, as well as the president of the Ministerial Association. In 2020 I ran for House district 04 and have filled that position since. ",
      "I would address energy independence and our standing in the nation, our southern border infiltration into our nation and state, and the US government over-reach of power. In the energy sector we must realize that reliable and cost-effective base load generation is the only thing that will keep America's lights on. We are on a fast track to becoming a 3rd world country. We, as the state of Wyoming, must look at how we can change the narrative and look at making coal the answer to clean effective generation once again.  The southern boarder is an open wound that continues to bleed and will destroy our nation and state. You can't have both a welfare state and an open boarder; it will never last. Wyoming has to stand up and make sure that we don't allow anyone not legally in this country to become a burden on the state or local systems. The federal government is out of control and needs to be stopped. That has to be the driving force behind everything we do. ",
      "Our job as the state legislature is to make sure that the constitution of the state of Wyoming as well as the US constitution, are being honored, and local laws are aligning with these standards. We are also charged with the responsibility to establish and uphold the role of government, which is to establish justice, provide for protection, and install and maintain infrastructure. ",
      "It is not in the role of government to take on housing, health care, or economic development.  Education is constitutionally protected and needs to be addressed, funded, and reformed. We need to lessen government regulations, which in turn, will make us as a state more economically friendly. Keeping taxes low will also help with economic development. Government housing has never worked well, and we will not be the first.  Our job is to facilitate an economy that empowers the people to succeed. We don't need another program to try to fix what the government messed up in the first place. ",
      "I feel that we should be willing to listen to everyone's viewpoint and what they bring to the table. With their experience we are stronger together. That being said, we must realize that there are things we can never compromise on such as the republican party platform, the constitution, and the Bible. Those are areas that must be held fast. ",
      "We are charged with being good stewards of the land. This means we must be wise in what we do. I am an avid hunter and angler and know the importance of conservation. I also worked in a coal fire power plant. I feel that we need to use common sense again and make sure that we are addressing the real concerns that face our land and wildlife, not chasing after environmental hysteria, or the foolishness we see coming out of special interest groups.

I was born Cheyenne Wyoming in 1956. Graduated from Central High School in 1974. Lived in Wyoming until 1979 when my job took me to McCook Nebraska and eventually to Fort Worth Texas.  Susan and I decided in 2013 when we retired to return to Wyoming.  She worked 21 years with FEMA and myself I worked just short of 40 years railroad experience including 37 years as a railroad dispatcher and other functions. Of those 37 years 22 years I was the dispatcher that controlled train movements up the Front Range from Denver through Ft collins, Cheyenne, Chugwater, Wheatland and from Orin Junction to Casper.",
      "Will  be 68 years old  on Election Day",
      "Attended the University of Wyoming  from 1974 off and on until 1976 majoring in Astrophysics and Computer Science. While attending McCormick Jr High and  Central High School in Cheyenne my Mother, Shirley Randolph worked for the Department of Education her boss being a Dr James who was head of the Advance Programs for Students in the State.  Instead of taking the bus home from classes I would walk to the Capitol Building and sit in the House Chambers during the legislation sessions and watch the proceedings and follow the debates and discussions At the end the day my Mother would come and get me and we drive to our home located in the far north end of Monterey Heights. My father was the night Manager of the popular restaurant known as the Owl Inn. I've served as committee man, precinct worker, union representative for many years. I've taken a active roll in testifying before various government groups for advocating stronger safety rules and enforcement in the railroad industry",
      "Recognizing the changing economic picture and realistically address these changes.  As state we have to diversify our economy from it's current reliance on fossil fuels, such as coal, oil and natural gas and begin to focus on our new discoveries of minerals and other sources of revenue that if properly developed could provide good jobs, a stable economy and a great opportunity for our state to once again lead segments of this country's in materials that a absolutely needed to move the United States well into the 21st Century while at the same time addressing pressing problems such was climate change and our economic goals for the state. This will at the same time create  good paying jobs and development of new technologies and encourage our youth to stay in Wyoming and be apart of this great opportunity.",
      "Much depends on the subject.  Example the development of our new discovered minerals wealth, that could be worth trillions of dollars will need to be developed by a great host of ideas and people. But at the same time the people need input so our life styles, culture and environment are taken into account and preserved.  We also must involve the local people for the impact of these developments will have on locals towns and cities.  Local input and funds must be made available to provide vital services, education, housing, medical and resources to allow people to live happily and comfortable while they provide the labor and knowledge needed to be successful in everyone's endeavors and provide a great experience and place to live",
      "Again, not waiting but to understand that these minerals and other industries related to their development cannot not wait until next decade, next election cycle, or even next year.  These are strategic minerals and industries that are already in short supply throughout the world and unfortunately not found in places friendly to the United States or the democracies in general. This is why there are ongoing movements to fast track the immediate development of these minerals and develop the technology to refine these minerals now .  This  is why the current legislative body is slow to understand and move to grease the rails on these developments and for some reason continues to devote to much effort and time to our 19th century past instead of the 21st century we live in today.",
      "In my time when I spent many days sitting in the gallery of the House of Representatives  when I was younger I listened to much debate and discussion of the issues of the time.  Powder River Basin Coal was just getting developed at this time. The Union Pacific and the Burlington Northern were just starting construction of the largest rail project in the United state in 60 years with the construction of the Orin Line. There was the debate of coal slurry pipe lines using Madison formation waters (ETSI) from Wyoming to Arkansas and Texas but eventually turned down when the Madison formation was not to be found as brackish as some people were saying and may be a future water source for Wyoming. The House and Senate were a little more balanced back then between the two parties but they still talked, sometime argued but in the end they still got the job done and made good laws and made this state for a time wealthy.  We have new realities we must face but good people can insure good results",
      "Talking with members of environmental groups already they understand  that it will be important to take into the consideration the environments impact of development of these minerals and technologies. They will continues to encourage restoring mined lands to as close as the original land before development.  They want strong watershed and water rules that will be enforced. They want to recycle much of the water used in various processes.  Possible swapping a development site for other land to protect wildlife and protect habitats.\r\nThey understand the development of these minerals and process to refine them eventually will lead to a lesser need for fossil and other climate impacting industries that in the end will lessen human impact on the climate and other problems we now face"

      "I have a profound affection for Wyoming and its residents, and I am eager to play a significant role in shaping our state's future and tackling the issues we confront. \r\n\r\nThroughout my life in Wyoming, I have often felt that our state legislators have not fully represented my views or the views of many of my fellow residents. I've observed a worrying shift among lawmakers who increasingly prioritize national political debates over addressing the real and immediate problems our state faces.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it's disheartening to see many of my peers leave Wyoming, taking their skills and potential contributions with them, because they don't see opportunities for a fulfilling future here. I am committed to offering thoughtful and constructive representation that supports the development of thriving, sustainable communities for all our citizens.",
      "To tackle Wyoming's biggest challenges, (which I believe to be the loss of our young people, and our volatile revenue structure)\r\nI would advocate for investments in healthcare (including the expansion of Medicaid), education, and local governments to make our towns more livable and attractive, thereby enhancing civic engagement and helping to reduce our brain drain. Furthermore, I aim to diversify our economic reliance away from volatile industries by focusing on the fast growing outdoor industry. State government plays a role in this by developing infrastructure that encourages responsible access and use of our landscapes, and updating policies that would broaden the responsibility of conservation, ensuring all stakeholders contribute fairly, easing the disproportionate burden of conserving our wild spaces hunters and ranchers have borne for decades. Strategic investment and inclusive policy-making will harness Wyoming’s strengths and secure a sustainable future for all residents.",
      "My views on local control are guided by a strong belief in the principle that the governments closest to the people—our counties and municipalities —are some of Wyoming's strongest assets. The state should intervene in local decisions only under specific circumstances: \r\n\r\n1. When jurisdiction is explicitly stipulated in state statutes.\r\n2. When local actions potentially threaten the constitutional rights of individuals as determined by the judiciary.\r\n3. When local elected leaders request state intervention.\r\n4. When the judiciary is unable to resolve disputes concerning policy between a local government and its citizens.\r\n5. When the state is crafting new policy that has no clearly delegated local authority.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, the goal is to respect the autonomy of local governments while ensuring that the rights and well-being of all Wyomingites are protected.",
      "The state can support a livable Wyoming by investing in infrastructure that enables communities to grow and attract businesses while also ensuring that the basic needs of our citizens are met through robust healthcare services and accessible, high-quality education.\r\n\r\nWyoming should actively support policy that makes housing more affordable and accessible by incentivizing private sector solutions and supporting public housing projects. In healthcare, expanding Medicaid would be a huge step toward ensuring that more Wyomingites have access to necessary services without undue financial burden. These policies help people live full, healthy, productive lives.\r\n\r\nEducation must be a priority, with state funding ensuring that our schools are not only well-equipped but also staffed by well-paid, highly-qualified educators.\r\n\r\nThe state's role is to provide the framework and support that empowers communities to innovate and grow while ensuring the safety net is strong for those who need it most.",
      "I am entirely willing to meet with and attempt to reach a compromise with anybody. Compromise is foundational to good governance, and kindness and open mindedness are central to my core values.",
      "I believe in striking a balance where both development and conservation contribute to Wyoming’s prosperity. We must recognize that our wild spaces are what make us unique and that they are incredibly valuable in radically different ways to a wide array of stakeholders. By promoting strategic planning and robust environmental standards, we can ensure that development in energy, industry, and real estate respects our cherished landscapes and wildlife. \r\n\r\nTruthfully the day to day work of accomplishing this lies primarily at the local level and within the executive branch. The legislature needs to ensure that those entities are well funded and have clear guidance on how to balance these competing interests.\r\n\r\nThis also involves fostering collaboration among stakeholders to innovate and implement development practices that safeguard our natural resources. I am committed to policies that support both our economic and environmental health, ensuring a sustainable future for all Wyomingites."

      "Wy's economy heavily relies on coal, natural gas, and other resources, and I would advocate for policies that support responsible extraction while balancing environmental concerns. This includes streamlining regulations to facilitate energy production and exploring opportunities in cleaner technologies to diversify our energy portfolio. Economic diversification is one key priority. With the decline in coal demand, fostering industries such as technology, renewable energy, and tourism becomes essential. I would champion incentives for businesses, promote entrepreneurship, and reduce regulatory barriers to attract diverse industries that can sustain our economy for the long term. Investing in education and workforce development is critical to preparing our workforce for emerging industries.",
      "I believe that decisions should be made at the lowest level of government feasible, where local leaders are most attuned to the specific needs and preferences of their constituents. Determining when a decision should be left to local leaders or made by the Wyoming Legislature involves careful consideration of several factors. First and foremost is the issue of constitutionality and whether the decision falls within the jurisdiction of local governance or requires state-level regulation. Matters that directly impact statewide interests, such as uniform taxation policies or major infrastructure projects crossing local jurisdictions, may necessitate legislative oversight to ensure consistency and fairness. I firmly believe in empowering local leaders to make decisions on matters that are primarily of local concern, such as zoning regulations, local economic development initiatives, and community-specific educational policies.\r\n",
      "I believe Wyoming's role in supporting the well-being of its citizens should prioritize fostering an environment where individuals and families can thrive through self-reliance and local community support. The state should facilitate policies that encourage economic growth and job creation, reduce regulatory burdens on businesses, and promote educational opportunities that prepare our youth for the workforce. Wyoming should also prioritize affordable and accessible healthcare solutions, encourage private-sector innovation in housing solutions, and maintain infrastructure that supports both urban and rural communities. Ultimately, empowering individuals and communities to make decisions that best suit their needs while upholding traditional values of hard work and personal responsibility is fundamental to ensuring the well-being of Wyoming citizens and their families.",
      "Of course there are some issues where compromise is possible but as with anything there are absolute truths that cannot be compromised. It would have to be an issue by issue basis.",
      "I prioritize responsible stewardship of Wyoming's wildlife and open spaces while promoting energy, industrial, and real estate development essential for economic growth. This balance requires sensible regulation that safeguards environmental health without stifling innovation or job creation. I support policies that encourage sustainable practices, respect property rights, and foster partnerships between stakeholders to achieve mutually beneficial outcomes for conservation and economic progress."

We must remember those issues that affect us today are not the only things we are faced with continuously.  We must provide a framework for lowering and broadening our tax base.  We are too volatile and one way to do that is lowering our taxes in general and providing more authority to our local elected officials to raise the taxes that they see fit instead of levying them only at the state level.  We also must work to secure our school funding and ensure our children have the success options available to them through an effective education with proper funding by the legislative body.",

      "49",
      "I was born and raised in the Intermountain West, the daughter of a homemaker who frequently took jobs at the library or local school to help pay for my braces or my brother's trombone lessons and a father who used the GI Bill after serving on the rifle team of the 82nd Airborne to go to school and study soil science. My father worked in remote areas, mapping the last unstudied soil in the U.S. which accounts for our frequent moves to some of the smallest out of the way towns in the West. We lived in Gillette in the 80’s when there was a boom and I’ve carried the wisdom from that time: when you have money, invest in libraries and education. The Campbell County Library built a new story pit and a school went up to serve the children of Sleepy Hollow. It strikes me as being a good code to live by- invest in what matters. Our longest stay was in the little town of Winnemucca, Nevada and what I jokingly refer to as a “suburb” of Winnemucca, the town of Golconda, population 200, give or take. Whatever town we were in, I knew there would be a 4H club, a little league team and a library where I could make friends and serve my community. It was in Winnemucca that my father and some friends built the first shooting range, hosting competitions and workshops that served our little town well. Us kids were all certified NRA Jr “Eagles” in a time when the NRA was an education and advocacy organization, not a propaganda tool of the alt-right. My husband Jason is also from a small town and when it was time to settle down and start a family, we set our sights on Cheyenne. For the last 26 years we have raised our children, Ash, 32, Atticus, 16 and Emerson, 13 here in the Capitol City. I have worked as a baker, a small business owner, a farmer’s market manager and for the last 8 years as the director of Wyoming Equality.  I love Wyoming in a deep and abiding way- I feel grafted onto this land in a way that borders on the absurd. I am not alone in that- I recognize that same fervor in so many people who make Wyoming their home. There is a way that we have carved out a space where we can retain our identities as individuals but lean on each other as a community that feels just right to me. And it seems worth fighting for.\r\n\r\n",
      "Wyoming is in danger of bankrupting our K-12 school system by buckling to well-funded, out-of-state school voucher PACs.  I will be an  advocate for your kids and mine. We can’t afford to play politics with our children’s future. The time for economic investment in Wyoming is today. High paying jobs will follow a robust investment in infrastructure. I will bring an aggressive voice for high speed rail, high-paying tech jobs, and a working Wyoming. \r\nBullies are using the government to interfere with women’s healthcare. Women are smart and we know how to make decisions in consultation with our families, clergy and physicians on how best to plan and care for our families.  I will work to bring people together to create solid policy that enshrines our rights as Wyoming women. There is a rising tide of incivility in our state and a shrinking number of people who remember the Wyoming value of working together to get the job done. \r\n",
      "There is a symbiotic relationship between actors at the state and local level. That relationship only works when there is trust between local citizens and our government. It is easy and it is craven to build a boogeyman out of state legislators, and vice versa. We score cheap political points at the cost of fraying that essential relationship.Through disinformation campaigns, politicians have campaigned on fear and distrust of government and have as a consequence weakened the very voices these politicians claim to represent. The key to balancing local control with state governance is robust input from municipal and county stakeholders at all levels of decision making.  As a member of the legislature I will fight to recognize the hard work done at the local level. As a Wyoming legislator I will curtail the current trend of sowing disinformation about our people and government so that we can restore trust that the Wyoming legislature works for its people.",
      "The state exists to secure the rights of the people, and the people of Wyoming deserve solid housing, healthcare, and education options. My track record is clear: I have always prioritized working families and their access to basic services as a fundamental right. We must support the expansion of Medicaid, fully fund K-12 education, and invest in affordable housing initiatives alongside property tax relief and sustainable economic growth.It's time to turn away from divisive culture wars and prove that Wyoming is a welcoming home for businesses, tourists, and families who value freedom and privacy. By fostering a supportive environment, we can attract high-paying jobs and ensure our natural beauty draws visitors from around the world. Together, we can create a state where every resident feels secure and valued, and where families can thrive for generations to come.",
      "What I love best about Wyoming is how we depend on each other. The Golden Rule of the Snowbank insists that we look beyond party affiliation or romantic partner and ask the question: how do I want people to respond when *I* am stuck in the snow bank?  Our political “opponents” are our neighbors, our friends, they're who we call on when we’re in crisis.  I am most proud of the depth of relationships I have had with clergy and members of evangelical, LDS, Catholic and others.  Many of my dearest friends are my political opponents. I am as proud of supporting coal miners in crisis as I am fighting for abortion rights with my Republican colleagues. I have always been inspired by the late Sen Enzi's approach to working with legislators with whom he disagreed.  When the senator passed it was a huge loss to Wyoming, but his commitment to finding common ground is the best way to honor his legacy.",
      "As in everything, we do our best work when stakeholders of good faith come together to work on solutions. We saw a shift in the conversation happen in 2017-2018 when a diverse group of hunters, anglers and energy leaders came together to preserve public land. Instead of a fight between extremists of all stripes it became a common sense argument that worked to expand a shared vision of a Wyoming that was open to thoughtful development but protected our right to hunt, fish and recreate. Balance is not always possible and sometimes legislators need to draw hard lines whether they are aligned with the well-funded majority or not. I think Wyoming voters are looking for leaders who can sit down with energy, industry, real estate as well as wildlife and advocates of open spaces. This is hard work and we will not always agree.  My approach to governance is not to find easily digestible solutions to seemingly intractable problems but to listen carefully and respectfully and lead with integrity."

We need to be responsible in the ways we impact wildlife and open spaces, and weigh the benefits and impacts of energy, industrial, and real estate development, and make a decision that is best for current and future citizens of Wyoming.\r\n"

      "I currently live in District 12 in South Cheyenne, near Terry Bison Ranch.  I have lived here for almost eight years now.  I was born on F.E. Warren AFB and raised on the southside of Cheyenne for most of my childhood.  My step-father received orders to Eielson AFB, AK when I was 13, so I attended and graduated high school there.  After playing college baseball for a short time, I returned to Wyoming to attend UW and complete my Bachelor's degree.  Despite growing up in a military family and moving around a lot in my previous career, I have lived in Wyoming for the majority of my life.",
      "40",
      "I am the product of a family with a long military tradition. Both my father and step-father served more than twenty years in the USAF and most of the men in our family have served in the military.  My mother spent more than twenty years working for the DOD in various positions, including for the Cheyenne VA for fifteen years, alongside my step-father, before they both retired.  Service and helping others has been ingrained in me since I was young.  We would volunteer on Thanksgiving to help out at the local VFW or do other work in the community because my parents believed it was important to give back to the community that supports you.  For the past eight years, I have worked in the Adult Education department at Laramie County Community College where we work with the students that the traditional education system was unable to reach or help complete their educational needs.  Now I hope to serve the state that has shaped my life and the person that I am today.",
      "I believe the role of a state representative and lawmaker is to listen to their constituents, solicit their input and ideas, and then work with area experts to craft solutions to the challenges or to take advantage of the opportunities that we have.  I am not an expert in all things.  I do not have all of the answers.  I also do not bring a preset agenda with me to the Wyoming House.  I plan to work with those who have Wyoming's best interests at heart and craft law that ensures Wyoming's prosperity well into the future.",
      "In most cases, I believe local control is the best method of ensuring a community's success.  I believe most economic legislation should have a component for input and control by local counties and cities.  This will ensure that their specific needs and circumstances are accounted for, and that local leaders can make decisions that are right for their communities.",
      "I believe it is the role of our government to lead in the areas of state prosperity and citizen support.  We as a legislature can ensure that an economic climate exists that attracts and encourages the best and brightest to do business, create jobs, and drive Wyoming's economy.  We can also create the conditions to encourage housing development and lower the barriers to home ownership.  This is also true of our education system.  We can ensure that our school districts are utilizing their funding appropriately and maximizing the impact that every dollar has on the outcomes of our students.  This requires attracting and retaining the best teachers in the country and providing them with the resources they need.  Finally, we as legislators have the means to provide Wyomingites with a high-quality healthcare system.  Developing programs that bring talented healthcare professionals to Wyoming is within the purview of the State Legislature and would benefit everyone.",
      "Completely.  One of the reasons I am running for the Wyoming House of Representatives is to bring a more reasoned approach to Wyoming politics.  I will not go in with a personal agenda that I will seek to enact.  Instead, I will go in looking to work with anyone with good ideas and good intentions.  Whatever their party affiliation, I am open to working with anyone. ",
      "Not easily.  It requires great effort on the part of a lawmaker to consult with those that know more than they do and weigh the competing interests of each.  A representative must also listen to their constituents and weigh their opinions on the matter.  Ultimately, a legislator is elected to make the tough decisions that balance the economic prosperity of Wyoming with its often unreplenishable resources and beauty."

      "I view the role of state government as creating a level playing field so that every citizen can be free to thrive in whatever role best fulfills their aspirations. That means we need to strongly support free public education for K-12 students, keep the cost of community college and University education as low as possible, and find ways to support affordable housing in all of our communities. If we have a well-educated work force and affordable places to live, economic development should naturally occur without the state attempting to direct how that happens.",

      "As a non-profit leader and economic developer, I have a desire to build an Equality State where all our hard working residents have the opportunity to thrive. My passion, empathy and 20 years of experience in grassroots community development have taught me to serve with humility and civility. Nothing happens outside of trusting relationships, common goals and collaborations. \r\n\r\nAs Director of Laramie Main Street, I work to build a vibrant downtown by engaging the community, supporting locally owned businesses, and leveraging our cultural assets. \r\n\r\nAs a current member of Wyoming's House of Representatives, I have championed funding for affordable housing, education and the conservation of our natural resources. I will continue to support policies to diversify our economy and preserve individual freedoms. \r\n\r\nIn my free time I enjoy kayaking, hiking, dog training, photography and the challenge of gardening at 7,220 feet!",
      "I am passionate about addressing affordable housing, diversifying our economy and preserving individual freedoms. As a legislator serving on the Appropriations committee, one of my biggest responsibilities is developing the budget. I will continue to make smart investments through the budget and craft laws that support strong families, good schools and safe communities. We need to invest in ourselves so Wyoming is a place where our children have opportunities to work and raise the next generation.",
      "When the legislature tries to devise a “one size fits all” statewide policy, we often miss the mark. While it is appropriate to have uniform standards for education, healthcare, and safe roads, state lawmakers should not override solutions that have been developed and vetted by community members. Government closest to the people is most responsive, and understanding, of local needs. \r\n\r\nWe all have a shared responsibility to work hard together and play our part. This includes knowing when to step in and help, and when to butt out and trust local leaders.",
      "\r\nThe state should remove regulations that hinder the delivery of essential services while investing in private-public partnerships to stimulate the market in responding to these needs. Where the private businesses might struggle with lack of financial resources, the state can offer grants and low interest loans. The state should support an economy that provides opportunities for hard working Wyomingites to get ahead. We should invest in education that will prepare our kids for good paying jobs and provide basic services, like affordable healthcare, to improve quality of life. ",
      "Compromise, civility and respect for the person, outside of their politics, is key to getting anything done. For the benefit of the people of Wyoming, I set aside my personal feelings and preconceived notions and happily work with anyone who is interested in improving the lives of our residents. ",
      "Government has a responsibility to protect our environment and natural resources while supporting economic diversification. Balanced zoning and industrial siting should ensure all of Wyoming’s communities have access to clean water, wildlife and healthy public lands. A balanced approach to development is transparent, proactive and collaborative around the shared goals of industry and community."

P & Z Comm., and as state representative for Wyoming House District 18 from 2016 to 2020.\r\n \r\nI am an advocate for economic development, limited government, local control, property tax reform, private property rights, public lands in public hands, second amendment rights, the bill of rights, investing in public infrastructure including use of more water from the Green River. I support the Tera Power project near Kemmerer, carbon capture and the coal, trona, oil and gas industries. \r\n\r\nGovernment regs. should not be intrusive into our daily lives and our elections are secure.\r\n\r\nFunding of private schools with state funds is unconstitutional. It will blossom into another out of control government spending program.  ",
      "Wyoming's biggest challenge going forward is its tax structure.  It's been the same problem for the last decade. Everyone needs to contribute to the solution and execrative industries cannot be asked to carry the load. The only real options are property tax and sales tax.  We all know what is happening with property tax so that leave us with sales tax modifications.",

My guide here is, does this issue treat local governments differently than it would private individuals. Local governments are full capable of determining what fits in their communities, what is or is not allowed on their property. ",
      "Concerning economic development, the state's role should be consistent and limited regulation and taxation. \r\nConcerning housing, development of property is driven by projected profits. It's the American way.\r\nIn my experience low income or affordable housing happens when government decides it must have it and is willing to bridge the difference between what the going private rate is and what subsidy the government is willing to pay.  I am not an advocate of the subsidy side of this process.\r\nHealth care is a mess. You can't take all your lifelong savings with you but the health care system sure can.  We need to keep working on reforms here.",

I am always willing to present by perspective but often find insight from others and if their information is credible and compelling then sure compromise is called for.

      "House District 18 is home to vast spaces and world-renowned wildlife and recreational areas, much of it on public land. At the same time nearly all the trona, large natural gas fields, processing plants and coal mines exist. New development needs to be managed for the benefit of the public as well as preservation of wildlife. To do that we need data from all stake holders. Currently large scale power trans., solar and wind energy projects are proposed. The impacts to the landscape are large and could easily adversely impact our wildlife. We need to know what the impacts are for the entire build out and not simply a project-by-project approach. We need to provide for multiple use that allows for development but preserves or mediates the impacts to our wildlife. "

      "I live and ranch in the Big Sandy area of Sublette County. I’ve spent most of my life in this county, moving here with my family when I was 12 years old (47 years ago) from a small town in southern Indiana. ",
      "59",
      "I was a teenage waitress who talked politics, graduated from Pinedale High, and married my oilfield roughneck boyfriend Jim at the age of 20. After our son graduated from Big Piney High School, Jim and I moved out to the Big Sandy area where we run livestock.\r\nI’m a reader and a writer with works published in articles, opinion columns, books and various news media, and scientific journals. I started in journalism at the Pinedale Roundup before becoming one of the founders of the Sublette Examiner. I quit the newspaper business to write non-fiction books and owned a sheep industry magazine for 12 years before selling it earlier this year. I write for a variety of publications.\r\nI’m a dedicated volunteer for groups and causes I support. I have a history of holding public officials accountable, promoting open government, researching and reporting on the facts, and challenging governments to improve flawed programs, including suing the federal government.",
      "Our challenges and opportunities are intertwined. We need to support our legacy industries while diversifying our economy. We should remain a top energy producer through development of our rich variety of energy resources. I support the Wyoming Energy Authority’s program to leverage investment for commercial deployment of Wyoming energy resources. \r\nI support efforts to develop infrastructure to disperse outdoor users into Wyoming’s smaller communities and into areas with room to grow. \r\nProtecting agricultural producers from bad federal policies is also important – to maintain our food and fiber production, as well as our open spaces and wildlife habitat.\r\nEconomic development won’t make sense if our workers can’t make a living wage and have an affordable place to live. Government should play a role in structuring policies that make it easier to thrive here: easing regulatory burdens and providing incentives for those providing childcare, healthcare access and affordable housing.",
      "The Wyoming Constitution provides for state obligations in certain areas (uniformity in taxation, providing system of public instruction, etc.).\r\nFor other areas, it hinges on the public purpose of the legislation, and my view that when the government seeks to impose its power on the people, it should do so using the lowest level of power needed to accomplish the goal. There must be an important public purpose to justify a top-down approach. \r\nI favor empowering local governments to make decisions in the best interests of their communities as much as possible, since our communities and their needs are so varied. The state impinging on local authority is like the federal government overstepping on state authority – I’m not a fan of either. \r\nAlong with my support for local control is my view that the government shouldn’t be sticking itself into every facet of our lives. I’m opposed to government overreach and unnecessary intrusion – whether by federal, state or local government.",
      "The purpose of government is to support the well-being of its citizens and protect our individual rights. Our constitution repeatedly calls for actions for “public good and general welfare” and support of the poor. \r\nSome view the proper role of government is to provide only basic services, such as fire protection, emergency medical services, law enforcement, and maintenance of roads and highways. Look at each of those services now; all are experiencing shortages because people can’t afford to live here and be engaged in providing these services that are vital to our well-being. \r\nState government can and should take a variety of action to support the public’s well-being: through regulatory reduction; providing state incentives for private investments; and targeted state investments and incentives for services, including those that ease the burden on those suffering from poverty, allowing them to become self-sufficient. This combination strengthens our communities and our economy.\r\n",
      "Compromise is cast as negative when it’s structured as giving up something to the opposition – but that’s not how I see most legislative compromises. Instead, they are structured so that two sides seek to define what parts they can agree on (a mutual acceptance of certain terms) while omitting the items in which agreement can’t be reached. It’s a difficult process and one I’m happy to engage in. It takes work and good-faith effort, and I believe those who engage in these efforts benefits by learning that we can find common ground on many divisive issues when we turn away from rhetoric and do serious work.\r\nIt involves not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good, and I’m all for that. It may not be getting all that you want, but it’s taking steps in the right direction, and those steps may be something you can build on later.\r\nBut some things can’t be compromised. For me, that includes adherence to the U.S. and Wyoming Constitutions, and the rights secured in those documents.",
      "I support multiple use and thoughtful site-specific solutions generated by stakeholders instead of blanket prohibitions. \r\nOnly 20% of Sublette County is private land, and 1 in every 5 acres of that is protected from development through conservation easements. Having such a high percentage of public land has huge impacts on our communities. We want families to be able to afford to live here and that means some development will occur.\r\nThe county land use planning process is key to striking a balance, as are the governor’s executive orders for important habitats. Both of those processes involve the public in seeking solutions and may allow for actions through adjustments to avoid and minimize impacts, as well as mitigation to address effects. \r\nWe need to maintain wildlife habitat functionality but concerns for wildlife should not be an excuse for blanket infringement on private property rights. Our public and private lands are intertwined and what happens on one impacts the other. "

The state has their responsbilities to provide services and support for the citizens of our state, based on the constitution.   Legislators need to look at the constitution when various laws are being introduced to make sure the proper role is being sought on governmental affairs.  The state needs to set the standard in budgeting the revenue to make sure we stay within our \"means\".

We will always work on providing quality education.  Funding for housing and health care is also important and needs to be handled prudently.  Economic development is vital to our state, and hopefully that can be some partnerships with private sectors to advance this work.",
      "Government has a long history of compromise between legislators and other officials.  It is not a perfect world, thus in order to get things accomplished, there generally has to be some compromise.  I certainly am aware of this need to get along and work with various government officials.  There are some key areas that in my humble opinion that I cannot compromise.  I believe it is always helpful to learn about people's perspectives and where they are coming from.  Sometimes it may make a different in how I would vote.  On key, core issues, I vote to represent the folks in my district, and to vote on my core beliefs and values.\r\nI strongly feel that I can work with all legislators and be friends with them.",
      "Both areas are highly important to the legacy of Wyoming.  Is it possible to appease both sides on this issue?  I believe it is possible.  It will take some strong and clear thinking to come up with solutions to this never ending matter.  We all want our state to grow and have our children stay in Wyoming, and we also want to keep having our state produce all the minerals, energy and other sources of power for us to use.  I think there can be balance and we have to be creative in how we manage these resources."

This will require making it possible for a more diverse economy to prosper and a tax policy that broadens our revenue sources in a way that is sustainable and equitable. There are numerous ways that the state can incentivize the factors that can lead to such a prosperous future; investing in our people and our communities is key to that future, and the legislature can direct funds appropriate to that goal: investing in community infrastructure, housing,  healthcare and education to ensure that families can and want to live here.",
      "Legislators claim to support local control until they don't, especially when it comes to local control in places like Teton County where legislators from elsewhere in the state feel they differ with our values or choose to listen to advocates for influential developers. When it comes to local land use planning, the state should not intervene at all because each county is unique. Wyoming, generally, could benefit from better land use regulations that help ensure protection of important wildlife habitats while building communities people want to live in. ",

These can all benefit from state investments and good state policies that the legislature should consider investments in our long-term health. Investing a modest percentage of the proceeds from the state's sovereign wealth fund in, for example, early childhood education, will help Wyoming families prosper, and help build a sustainable economy outside of minerals.

I won over the House and Senate but failed to win over the Governor. It was a good lesson in recognizing what it takes to get to the finish line.",
      "The work to map migration corridors for ungulates is a great example of identifying critical areas that wildlife rely on; we should have the political will to protect such habitats, recognizing that energy development can be accessed outside of those limited areas. We do need to balance competing demands, but we also need to understand that climate change will impact species in critical ways as well over the long-term and recognize that threats such as disease and invasive species are also impacting wildlife.

Meddling in the local arena by passing laws that effect these groups directly and are decisions that should be left to these groups it's not good government. Listening to constituents who are involved in each of these areas of local control is the best way to ensure that the legislature stays out of their business.",
      "I'm a strong supporter of education, health care and affordable housing. Education should be funded adequately as within The states means. EMS workers are underfunded, and yet help support hospitals through their endeavors. We all want someone to come when we dial 911 and ask for an ambulance or a fire truck. Economic development has many components including continued worker development or education, adequate and fair housing, and a living wage. The legislature should endeavor to help with the infrastructure, water and sewer for housing, making sure not to pick winners and losers. Offering continued education at the community college level, both online and in person, are ways of lifting up people and giving them more certificates and skills to get better paying jobs. Supporting community colleges will do that.",
      "Within reasonable means.",
      "The sudden rush of real estate development has everyone paying attention to the loss of open spaces. When open space is lost, wildlife often lose. Ensuring that there are zones of less development will keep areas with enough open space to provide habitat for wildlife."

      "Worland, Wyoming. I grew up in Wyoming and moved out of state for law school. I lived out of state until May 2001. I was born in Lake Charles, Louisiana. ",
      "68 years old",
      "\r\nI grew up in Wyoming where I graduated from Worland High School and the University of Wyoming. I moved to Texas to attend Baylor Law School, where I graduated and then practiced law in Houston specializing in business litigation. \r\n\r\nWe moved back to Worland in 2001. And I began serving my community including serving on the board of Washakie Development Association, our local economic development group. I also served on the board of the Washakie Museum & Cultural Center and was President during the construction of the new museum. \r\n\r\nI also served as a member of the Northwest College Foundation board, raising money for student scholarships. I served on the original leadership team for Washakie Leadership Institute, a local leadership development program of the UW and taught conflict resolution. \r\n\r\nIn 2022 I was asked to run for House District 27. I began my service to the people of District 27 on January 10, 2023. I currently serve on the Education Committee and the Minerals Committee. ",
      "Our biggest challenges include fighting back against Federal government overreach that threatens our industries, families & our way of life; tax reform; providing services taxpayers expect in more cost effective ways; more transparency in education funding; and mental health. Wyoming’s biggest opportunities include responsibly managing our resources and economic growth opportunities for the benefit of the Wyoming we all love. ",
      "I believe the government closest to the people is best. True local control requires locally elected officials to allow citizens meaningful access and in put into local decision making. However, there are statewide issues & Constitutionally mandated responsibilities the state must address. In deciding on when a decision should be left to local control, I first look at the Wyoming Constitution to determine if the matter is a responsibility of the legislature. If not, I consider whether the circumstances indicate that a statewide standard might be needed. Finally, I consider whether in the situation at hand the locally elected officials are actually giving citizens access and in put. In other words, is their truly local control through a meaningful process in real time or is there local control in name only. Local control is meant to be more than just voting in the next election. ",
      "The state’s first responsibility is to honor its obligations under the WY Constitution. Providing free public education, public safety and maintaining a balanced budget are a few constitutional mandates of state government. Additionally, our state has a constitutional obligation to make decisions based on the will of the Wyoming people. I don’t believe most people in Wyoming want government run healthcare. However, most do recognize the need for the Department of Health to manage public health issues and federal programs like Medicaid at current levels. However, I believe most citizens in Wyoming want the state to address mental health issues. The state has a vested interest in helping families in Wyoming with mental health challenges. I find more diverse views on government involvement in housing and economic development. I believe our housing issues are an impediment to economic growth and effects many WY families. I also believe WY can benefit from responsible economic development. ",
      "I respect our constitutional system of government in Wyoming. Therefore I respect that every duly elected legislator has won the privilege of representing their constituents. While it may seem old fashioned and out of vogue these days, I believe all legislators have a constitutional obligation to make a good faith effort to work with others to address the challenges and opportunities Wyoming is facing. The entire legislative process is based on this principle. That said, you can’t make people work with others. I am willing to work with others and understand that incremental changes are valuable as a tool to make progress on issues. The unwillingness to negotiate with others leads to the gridlock most Wyoming citizens have expressed great frustration over. ",
      "Great question! One of the most challenging things we do in the Wyoming Legislature is balancing different important interests. I believe it would be beneficial to bring together key stakeholders in each of the areas mentioned to engage in a process of listening and learning. Only working together can we solve these important priorities. I don’t believe going to one extreme or the other on any of these areas would benefit Wyoming and our way of life."

      "55",
      "Most important, I'm a father of six and a husband who works hard to provide for and protect my family. That has included caring for my mother-in-law who passed from Alzheimer's, my middle daughter who survived childhood leukemia, my wife who survived triple-negative breast cancer, and my youngest son who has Down syndrome. Part of caring for them included knowing when it was time to leave a state that had gone hopelessly progressive with high taxes, high crime, gun control, and state intrusion into family life. \r\n\r\nI've been asked by many in my new home to help preserve our way of life, including the endorsement of my current house rep, Mark Jennings. I'm a Sheridan County Precinct Committeeman and former member of the City of Sheridan Planning Commission. I work as the Chair for the Department of Political and Military Science at American Military University with a PhD in Political Science. I'm also a former public school teacher and have an MA in Education. ",
      "Sheridan County has four representatives and two senators, so the first task is to work with them to properly represent the people of our county at the state level. Voters are concerned about out-of-state money inflating housing prices alongside property taxes, as well as federal pressures to shut down our mineral and natural resource industries to replace them with expensive and inefficient wind turbines. As one of 93 legislators, all I can do is speak for the people of House District 30 and look to work with like-minded communities across the state to protect the way of life here. ",
      "Local control closest to the people of a community works best in a republican form of government. One-size-fits-all policies from the state down to the local level typically are not necessary and are sometimes counterproductive. The people of Sheridan, for instance, are not eager to live in the same political climate of Jackson. That said, the state must step in if localities are violating the constitutional rights of people. ",
      "Having fled the state of Illinois because of their top-down, state-centered, high-taxing, big-spending, government programs to address these very same issues, I've seen the road to hell paved with good intentions. The state's role in supporting the wellbeing of of Wyomingites should be to provide a business-friendly free-market environment so most people are able to take care of themselves and each other without being dependent on the state. Such programs should be reserved only for those who truly need them, which has the added benefit of being able to provide more help to those with nowhere else to go. ",
      "That depends on the issue. Budget issues always have debate. I'm not always going to agree with fellow conservatives on everything, let alone the members from the Democratic Party. Still, I'm not willing to negotiate away constitutional right and liberties just to get another bill passed or because the feds are dangling money in front of us.  ",
      "This question just about encompasses every aspect of life in Wyoming. Ultimately the land use should be determined by those who live on the land. My job would be to represent what the people of HD 30 want done in the state legislature. It's neither the job of the legislature to centrally command industry and development nor pick winners and losers. The job is to provide a legal framework under which these decisions are made by free people. However, I would go to bat to wrest control of as much of Wyoming as possible from the federal government.

      "The Home Rule Amendment to the Wyoming Constitution passed in November of 1972 with more than 75% voting Aye.  While the state Supreme Court has not acknowledged the shift in power of the amendment, the legislators’ oath to the state constitution must accommodate the intention of the people.  Specifically, unless there is a compelling reason to adopt legislation that applies to all cities and towns uniformly, the purpose of the statute should specifically allow for local application.\r\n\r\nOne approach to determining this is evaluating if the exact same direction would be feasible, logical or effective in Big Horn County as it is in Laramie County.  If not, then the language of a bill should reinforce Home Rule.",
      "In keeping with the basic principles of freedom and free markets, the role of the state in supporting the well-being of citizens must determine how any program or service would preserve the first and consider the second.  Our low population severely hinders viable free market solutions to citizen needs.   Leveraging the efficiencies of capitalism with critical public needs through public-private partnerships makes it possible to retain a balance without infringing on freedom, diminishing the benefits of free markets or dismissing the very real needs of people who need a hand up and not a hand out.\r\n\r\nLoans are better than grants, developing self-sufficiency should always be a goal of any citizen safety net and recognizing that government can be a part of a solution but not the entire solution is essential.",
      "The late Senator Mike Enzi spoke often about how to move forward in governance by finding common ground on the 80% or so that people can agree upon and avoiding the 20% that is contentious.  I see the problems occurring when individuals come into a discussion married to a specific “answer” before hearing any other views and be unwilling to deviate from that position.  When we start with defining a common goal or outcome instead, the possibility exists for all parties to participate in finding effective solutions and in the discussions, identifying alternatives that had not been considered previously.\r\n\r\nCompromise cannot be a dirty word in governance.   Compromising on crafting effective legislation is not compromising on principles.  In fact, robust and respectful debate and consideration can garner results that honor differing principles as well as perspectives.",
      "Our County Commissioners are extremely effective in creating balance through their statutorily mandated comprehensive land use plans.  Each of the 23 counties differ in the natural resources, wildlife and open spaces.  They also differ in the demands for energy, industrial, commercial and residential use of those same lands.  The best possible action from the legislature is to ensure the Counties have the resources, financial and technical, that are needed to keep the land use plans current and to provide expertise as necessary to their consideration.\r\n\r\nAny legislation proposed to address these competing demands at a state-wide level should be constrained by the need for county specific implementation.  Just as with Home Rule for municipalities, there must be a compelling case for directive language that applies uniformly across the state."

      "I was born in Arizona and spent my early years there. I eventually spent about eight years in Kansas where I finished my degree in Animal Science at Kansas State University and picked up a wife on my way to Wyoming. I have been in Wyoming since 1976 and lived in the Dubois area for 46 years. I have been married for 47 years and my wife and I raised two sons and one daughter in Dubois.  I am currently retired from the ranch where I was the manager for 41 years but currently do commercial property management for a previous ranch owner.",

      "I grew up with ranching and farming, part-time placer gold operations in central Arizona and real estate. The focus of my adult life has been cow/calf/yearling operations. As a Board Member for our local Conservation and Rural Fire Districts, I have been involved with budgets for Special Districts and the enabling legislation and have worked with local legislators when needed. I have participated in the Shoshone Forest Plan Revision, the Fremont County Natural Resource Plan Revision, Fremont County's Wyoming Public Lands Initiative (BLM Wilderness Study Areas) and Governor Mead's Task Force on Forests. These participations have given me knowledge of Federal and State lands in Wyoming and especially Fremont County. Living in a small town and community, I have seen the swings in Wyoming's economy and the effects the swings have on our services, our population, and the age of our population.",
      "I would continue to support the core industries that have made Wyoming the great state that it is. I know that coal, oil, and gas are under pressure today and believe that we need to continue to try to find new technologies that will continue to make our energy production a part of the total national power grid. I believe that lawmakers need to have discussions, not arguments, about our challenges and opportunities and continue to do so until solutions are found. One of our greatest challenges is keeping our youth. We have a great education system that is turning out excellent qualified youth, but we need to have a business climate that allows them to seek opportunities and stay in Wyoming. ",
      "When local issues are not the same throughout the State, those issues should be left to the local leaders. When issues are mostly the same throughout the State and have the same effects, then, maybe, the Legislature should have those discussions with their local leaders and see if State action is warranted.",
      "All of those issues are more relevant today then they were yesterday, and the State must be more supportive of private sectors. That support may be in the form of short-term relief from taxes, infrastructure support or waiving some fees for housing issues. Also, possibly, the State should be looking at providing the healthcare profession with a regulatory climate that allows healthcare operations to fit their communities. That may include intervening on behalf of local healthcare providers against the federal government. I believe our education system is very good and may only need some tweaks. Economic development should be a multi partnership between the State, all cities and towns, and the University of Wyoming.",
      "All of life is a compromise or negotiation. If we cannot have discussions where all thoughts are heard, we will only move backwards. Working with federal land management plans has taught me that all participants must be heard but I believe I know when to stand firm and when to negotiate to do the best for the citizens of Wyoming.",
      "The competing demands all have their place. I believe the open spaces provided by ranchers and farmers are of the utmost importance to wildlife and that should always be a partnership with Wyoming's wildlife managers. That being said, any form of development, large or small, should be feasible as long as the affected parties are willing to consider the impacts and work to mitigate them."

If local authorities possess the necessary expertise, resources, and capacity to address an issue, they should be empowered to do so. For example, local school boards managing educational policies can better cater to their specific student populations and community needs.\r\n\r\nIn determining when a decision should be left to local leaders or made by the Wyoming Legislature, I will evaluate the scope of the issue, the capacity of local governments, and the potential impact on statewide equity and uniformity- balancing local autonomy with the need for cohesive state policies.",
      "Housing: The state should facilitate affordable housing initiatives by providing incentives for developers to build low-cost housing and offering financial assistance programs for first-time homebuyers.\r\n\r\nHealthcare: Expanding access to healthcare, particularly in rural areas, is essential. The state should invest in telemedicine to bridge the gap in healthcare services for remote communities. Incentivizing medical professionals to work in underserved areas can also help alleviate healthcare shortages.\r\n\r\nEducation: Ensuring robust funding for K-12 and higher education is vital. The state should support programs that enhance STEM education, vocational training, and career readiness to align with Wyoming’s economic needs.\r\n\r\nEconomic Development: The state should promote energy projects, support small businesses, and attract new industries through tax incentives and infrastructure investments.",
      "As a lawmaker, my commitment to serving the best interests of Wyoming’s citizens means I am willing to engage in constructive dialogue and collaboration with legislators and officials holding different perspectives. Effective governance requires collaboration, open-mindedness, and the ability to find common ground, even in a highly politicized environment. It involves listening to diverse viewpoints, understanding the underlying concerns of all parties, and seeking mutually acceptable outcomes.\r\n\r\nIn the face of intimidation tactics and politicization of every daily choice, it is crucial to remain focused on the issues at hand and to engage respectfully and factually.\r\n\r\nUltimately, my candidacy is rooted in the belief that progress often requires finding a middle path, and that collaborative efforts can achieve more for our state than rigid adherence to ideological extremes.",
      "Balancing the competing demands of wildlife and open spaces with energy, industrial, and real estate development requires a strategic and nuanced approach.\r\n\r\nThis involves designating specific areas for conservation and others for development, ensuring that critical habitats and open spaces are preserved while allowing for responsible growth. Utilizing tools like geographic information systems (GIS) can help identify and protect ecologically sensitive areas.\r\n\r\nCollaboration with stakeholders is crucial. Engaging with industry representatives and local communities can help create balanced policies that address the needs and concerns of all parties. Public input and transparent decision-making processes ensure that diverse perspectives are prioritized.\r\n\r\nBy balancing protection with progress, we can achieve a harmonious coexistence between wildlife conservation and development, ensuring a sustainable future for Wyoming’s natural and human communities."

My husband was born and raised in Casper WY.  I am an informed citizen, looking to represent the people of HD38. ",
      "Today we need fiscal responsibility within the state legislature. One of the biggest challenges for the citizens is property taxes & the rate at which they are increasing. We need true reform and relief to be in place to allow for economic growth that happens when people have money to spend. One way to do this is to freeze and reduce the state budget.  \r\nAnother challenge facing Wyoming is the Federal Regulations on coal, oil, and gas. Wyoming needs our minerals industry to succeed. It pays for many amenities and funds a large part of our budget. It drives our state economy. We as Wyoming lawmakers need to make sure we are protecting our state first by generating constitutional laws to protect our industries.  Another challenge we face as Wyoming is our aging population. We need to do better at generating industry that will keep younger generations here.  We need to be attracting them by low tax rates for personal and small businesses, personal liberty and freedom.

For future generations we need to preserve and protect our iconic landscapes. There needs to be a balance that only benefits Wyoming not harm it. An example is the Wind Turbines. The blades have been being disposed of in the Casper landfill. Rather we should take those blades to the border, stand them on end, bury about 20 foot and put side to side and construct a border wall. That is a responsible decision to help protect Casper's landfill, and a repurpose of the green energy. Id be happy to provide further insight on preserving wildlife and balancing mans' eco systems when I have more time and space to do so. Thank You.  "

I raised my family in Johnson County and have worked in Johnson County  as a CNA, EMT, Public Health Response Coordinator, and Emergency Management Coordinator spanning  30 years.  I created and operated a small business called The Mini / MiniArrow Publications.

      "Wyoming has been home since 1996. I arrived the same month I turned 18 and graduated high school, having sold everything I owned to buy a Greyhound bus ticket. I had about $100 and a curiosity to experience the West. I originally lived in Teton County, where I quickly learned hard work was the most important thing to a beautiful Wyoming life. There, I learned the value of community and found the freedom to pursue my version of happiness.  \r\n\r\nIn 2014, my husband Mike and I welcomed our third child. Housing in  Jackson, while constantly challenging, had become impossible for our family. Considering our options, we agreed leaving Wyoming was off the table. A great career opportunity for Mike presented itself in Cheyenne, and we arrived in August of that year. Since then, we've kept busy raising our family, building our careers and my small business, and enjoying the lives we've created in a community we love. ",
      "I will be 46 years old on Election Day.",
      "My career in non-profits started 25 years ago as the Program Director for the Latino Resource Center. (This org has since become part of One-22 in Teton County.) During this time, I discovered a talent for grant writing, program development, and financial management. \r\n\r\nAs my husband and I built our family, I took leave from my non-profit work and started bookkeeping for small business clients from home. \r\n\r\nIn 2017, I returned to non-profit work as the Development Director for Habitat for Humanity in Laramie County. \r\n\r\nIn 2022, I decided to grow my business, Sol Solutions. Today, I help small businesses, non-profits, and families meet their goals with bookkeeping, grant writing, and organizing services.\r\n\r\nIn Wyoming, even Democrats understand government can't and should not try to solve every problem. Wyomingites rely on businesses and non-profits to provide those services and programs. I am proud to be a part of this tradition through a career serving those who do the work daily. ",
      "Wyomingites need tireless advocates for our state's values and traditions to tackle our communities' challenges. Our state governments' departure from productive legislative sessions in favor of debates over out-of-state culture war issues has led Wyoming down a troubling path of stagnation. Wyomingites have grown tired of the noise or, worse, given into a cynicism reflected in low voter turnout and declining civic engagement. \r\n\r\nIt's not too late to course correct. The resilience of Wyoming values will prevail. Folks who love Wyoming understand the freedom to pursue our happiness comes with an obligation to work hard and do what needs to be done, even when conditions are challenging. \r\n\r\nAs a lawmaker, I will tirelessly advocate for the Wyoming way of life and innovative solutions that serve us all. Together, we can work through problems and build on Wyoming's many strengths. Conditions will be difficult, but a life built on Wyoming values has prepared me to meet the challenge. ",
      "Government should be as close to the people as possible. State government should strive to provide the framework, resources, and tools for local governments to address issues facing their communities with solutions tailored to local conditions.\r\n\r\nRecently, we've seen a troubling departure from this Wyoming tradition. Legislation and executive orders have dictated uniform state control of school districts, elections, and healthcare. The concentration of power at the state level ignores Wyoming's varied and diverse communities, sending a message that the state knows better than those working tirelessly to make those places so uniquely Wyoming. \r\n\r\nThe people of Wyoming have grown cynical of politics in Cheyenne, and rightly so. Multi-generational and transplanted Wyomingites who truly value living in a place like no other where the pursuit of happiness is free for everyone need leaders who value local control and a functional, pragmatic legislature. These values are worth the hard work.",
      "Wyoming already has the tools and resources to address housing, health care, education, and economic development. Outlined in the framework of our state constitution is the legislature's obligation to protect and support the well-being of Wyomingites, fully fund education, and protect individuals' right to make their own medical decisions. \r\n\r\nThis framework and our currently available resources are already in place, yet the legislature still needs to meet these obligations, especially in recent years. Our failure to expand Medicaid is a prime example. Wyomingites already pay for this program through federal taxes. The expansion will make healthcare more accessible to our workforce, and our business community has long advocated for the program to relieve their workforce retention issues. \r\n\r\nExamples of available tools and accessible resources to address affordable housing, mental health, and education abound. A return to pragmatic legislating to meet the people's needs is imperative.",
      "Wyoming's political landscape should not be dominated by a single ideology; compromise is the cornerstone of our form of government. This is particularly crucial in a state cherishing individual liberty above all, where diverse beliefs and views have traditionally coexisted in a spirit of civility and respect. \r\n\r\nWyoming Democrats are a part of our state's history and the values that shaped our state. In 2024, a historically low number of Democrats are running for office, reflecting a hostile political climate imported from out-of-state recent arrivals with an erroneous idea of what Wyoming is and a lack of respect for our long-held values. \r\n\r\nThe spectrum of representation has shifted to the hard right because more than 50% of moderate Republicans don't vote in state primaries. I stand on the shoulders of Wyoming Democrats and Republicans who've shaped my views and on the Laramie County Democratic Party platform, representing the values of Wyoming Democrats and Republicans alike. ",
      "Protecting public lands is an issue that transcends politics. Wyoming's way of life depends on its public lands and many uses. Our tourism industry thrives as folks from around the globe come to see the natural beauty of our state. Our public lands give Wyomingites the space to hunt, fish, challenge themselves physically, and find the peace and tranquility that makes life in Wyoming so worthwhile. \r\n\r\nLocal control is vital to balancing the competing demands of economic growth and industry and our collective desire to protect our lands. When power is removed from local folks and concentrated at the state level, lobbyists and corporate interests have much more sway, and the land a community relies on becomes less vital. Wyoming should hold to its value of protecting our public lands, understanding the resources they contain only hold their value if we manage them responsibly with a focus on keeping these lands wild and accessible for generations to come.

      "Tax reform is a big deal to everyone, so to fix that we need to reform government spend. If we cut back spending for a few years we can change our tax structure without sacrificing our schools and the Wyoming people's pockets. In the process we need to bring jobs that employee and invest in the Wyoming working class. ",
      "It's important when making decisions on the State level to communicate with local officials such as city, county, school boards and other important agency's and church leaders who are closest to the people. It's important to get involve in the community to understand the needs of everyone. ",

We currently have billionaires coming to Wyoming that don't employee but a handful of people. We can bring companies that support those industries and bring more jobs to Wyoming. We need to support the teachers who just want to teach and not push agendas be able to feel safe in the classroom to stick to basics and not be pressured or burdened to teach social issues. We do need to focus on our trade schools and healthcare workforce. Investing in the education and training of those that join the trade we will help Wyoming retain a strong workforce and job security for our growing population. This will also help the growing elderly population secure healthcare workers to help them. I believe by adding civics at all levels of education we can help build a kinder more productive society, more unity and volunteering to help our community.",

I believe solar and wind can share space leaving room for housing and free land not only for the wildlife but for human life as well. Wyoming has a lot of potential without compromising our freedoms. Wildlife is a natural resource we need to protect. Just like we need to protect the use of our natural energy resources from over regulation."

      "I currently live in beautiful West Side Laramie. My husband and I bought our home here in 2018 but I have lived in Laramie since 2014. I was born in Pueblo, Colorado. ",
      "35",
      "I grew up poor, sometimes on public assistance. In 2005, like so many other families, we lost our home to foreclosure. A year later a fire burned my grandmother's house down, my second home. With two permanently disabled parents who did everything they could to provide but weren’t able to get ahead, I knew that the deck was stacked against me. At 16 I left home and school.\r\n\r\nThrough hard work, piles of student debt, and the grace of those who believed in me, I beat the odds, went to college, and earned my Ph.D. at the University of Wyoming.\r\n\r\nMy obsession with justice has driven my research on the psychology of the American legal system and guided my advocacy efforts in my community. In 2018, I co-founded Albany County for Proper Policing, which worked diligently towards transparency and accountability of local law enforcement – work that I have taken to the legislature on behalf of my community. \r\n",
      "While my role as a legislator is to bring legislation to solve Wyoming problems, I can’t do that work well without imput from my community and the people most impacted by Wyoming’s toughest struggles. During my time in the legislature, I have sought the input of the people who are directly impacted by the policies we propose or laws that aren’t working. In my work towards transparency and accountability of our justice system, I have worked alongside my community and spoke with youth who have been incarcerated in our state facilities. Now, as I work to find housing solutions for the people of Wyoming, I have been meeting with mobile home tenants and renters so I can better understand the issues that have most impacted them. Too often, lawmakers are focused on inviting stakeholders, but I believe we can’t bring real solutions without our impacted communities, so I have worked to include them in the work of state government.  ",
      "It is ironic that legislators complain of federal overreach and then micromanage our local governments to suit their political agendas. It is important to consider what local elected officials can and cannot do when we make decisions that impact the entire state. If a locally elected school board can make policies that better reflect their community, then it isn’t necessarily appropriate for legislators to dictate how they do their job. On the other hand, if a problem is presented that doesn’t fall under the powers of a county commission or city council, then it may be appropriate for the legislature to weigh in, assuming the solution proposed fits under the Wyoming State Constitution. \r\nIt's also important to consider how the legislature has tied the hands of local officials by restricting how they can raise funds to pay for local services. If the legislature is not willing to expand revenue options for towns and counties, then we should support local efforts through the state budget. ",
      "The state legislature should stop focusing its time on national rhetoric and problems that don’t exist and dedicate its time to these critical problems. Each of these issues are connected, so working towards solutions for one will benefit the others. We need to support affordable housing solutions for hard working young people so they can afford to raise their families here and benefit from our incredible public education system. We must focus on healthcare affordability and access so businesses have a healthy workforce. We must support our public education system so our children are setup to succeed in their personal and professional lives. And, we must support our small businesses and local economies so they can continue to provide jobs in our communities so our young people can afford to stay here. ",
      "I am willing to compromise with my colleagues and other officials so long as that compromise does not harm the people of my community or the state of Wyoming, and that compromise brings us closer to solutions for today and future generations. As a member of the minority party, I often do not get what I want in a supermajority state government, but I know that making progress towards a brighter future is far better than no improvement at all. ",
      "Wyoming’s heritage is our wildlife and wide-open spaces and it’s important we preserve it for future generations. That means we need a diverse energy sector that doesn’t contribute to climate change but is also regulated in a way so it does not get in the way of migration and critical habitat. While renewable energy sectors can help us move away from our reliance on the fossil fuel industry, we can’t mindlessly move in that direction, and we should still weigh the costs and benefits using the best science available.\r\n \r\nAbove all, Wyoming must look towards a more diverse economy, revenue structure, and jobs that support our hard-working Wyoming communities while also preserving our wildlife and natural spaces for future generations.  \r\n"

Low taxes, vast resources, wildlife, recreation, and beautiful landscapes will continue to work for Wyoming's citizens. "

      "1. I have served in the House of Representatives for the past 12 years and have an understanding of state government and how it's three branches are intended to serve the citizens of the state.\r\n2. I was a private business owner for 35 years serving the oil & gas industry. I understand the importance and challenges of being an employer in Wyoming.\r\n3. I have six children that all went through the state's public education system with five of the six graduating from the University of Wyoming, which I feel gives me a sense for the challenges and expectations parents have for the state's education system.",
      "I've come to the conclusion through my 12 years in the legislature the most important exercise a legislator can be engaged in is to help define what the \"role of the state is\" on any issue whether it is a challenge or an opportunity.  Once we determine the role of the state, then you can formulate and adopt the polices to ensure needs of state and its citizens are addressed and government intervention is kept at an appropriate level. ",
      "There is always a concern that the legislature will usurp local control, but my experience in the legislature is that when a difficult decision comes before a local governmental entity (county, city, school district, or other political subdivision) that may not get resolved immediately or isn't resolved to the satisfaction of all the stakeholders, there is often an effort on the part of the citizens to have the state intervene on the matter.  Again this is why it is important for a legislator to understand the role of the state, and to resist the temptation of involving the state is a matter that should be left for local control.  \r\nHowever, if an issue arises that impacts all local jurisdictions is a similar manner, then a policy through state law may be warranted, once the role of the state is determined.\r\n",
      "This question is certainly appropriate, I believe the state does have a role in supporting the well being of its citizens, but it is an error in my opinion to suggest each of the examples listed are equal in importance and the state's role is the same for each of them. They are all interrelated and are issues all states not just Wyoming are trying to resolve.   In priority I would list them as: #1 Education because of constitutional requirements. #2 Health Care because providing health care in a \"frontier\" state proves difficult in a way that funds the level of services citizens expect, with the capacity to generate sustainable revenue to support the required professions and ongoing operational costs. #3 Economic Development opportunities that currently avail themselves to the state require  concerted efforts to clearly define how each can fit into our economy and future over the next century . #4 Housing where government has a limited but important role.",
      "I feel that I have established myself as a legislator who reaches out to all impacted parties i.e.  state agencies, business, industry, special interest groups, and citizens as I draft  legislation to make sure I understand their concerns and have worked with them to resolve issues they might have.  There are of course times when differences remain and the success or failure of the legislation is determined through debate in the legislative process, sometimes I am successful, and sometime my efforts fail, but I try to never bring new legislation that is a surprise to those who will be impacted by the bill.  If my efforts fail I am generally  able to work during the interim on the issues that caused it to fail and through this same process bring a \"new and improved\" version back for consideration the next session.",
      "Wyoming has a successful historic approach of \"multiple use\" for state lands and the federal public lands it administers, and has addressed the unique needs of industry, wildlife and open spaces through collaboration with the impacted stakeholders.  The challenge we are trying to deal with currently has come as the Federal Government has imposed new regulations through rule or executive orders that have not complied with existing law, most important of which is to consider the state's approach to resolving the issues that arise. \r\nI strongly believe Wyoming has in place the mechanism to determine a balance when there are conflicting demands of all these critical uses of the state's resources, and that mechanism is to get the impacted parties in the same room to work out reasonable solutions for the collective good of the state."

In 2021, I was appointed to the Governor’s Wyoming Wildlife Task Force (WWTF) and was fortunate to work on top-priority wildlife policy issues with State Representatives, Senators, County Commissioners, and our Wyoming Game & Fish Department. I have been actively engaged with the City of Casper, County Commissioners, and State Legislators in policy-making for almost 10 years. ",
      "Serving on the Governor's WWTF, I learned the importance of understanding issues from a variety of perspectives, leaning on experts to help me understand, and the critical importance of engaging constituents and those impacted by decisions made. My profession has enabled me to become skilled in leadership, engaging in civil discourse, building consensus, and creating opportunities to work together in solving problems. ",

In order best balance the demands on our natural resources, we must be committed to understanding stakeholder perspectives, relying on industry and wildlife/habitat experts and the science/data driving decisions, and engage the constituents/residents/businesses impacted by decisions made.

I'd recommend taking one issue at a time as they arise and working the issue with multiple inputs and voices.  Alaska has been very successful in developing industry in the middle of some of the most sensitive wildlife lands on the planet.  Careful management has allowed massive resource extraction while growing the caribou numbers, polar bear numbers, fowl and native populations.  It can be successfully accomplished. "

      "Wyoming is my home, and I’ve been committed to its people my whole life. I served in Wyoming’s Army National Guard. I married my high school sweetheart in Cheyenne. I can’t think of a better place to raise my daughter. Wyoming deserves someone who cares more about leadership than political theater, and I believe I am that person. \r\n\r\nOver the years, I have served our community in various capacities that have helped prepare me for this role. While serving on the steering committee for the Department of Health’s State Health Improvement Plan, I got to see how suicide and substance abuse and limited access to healthcare services is impacting our communities. While serving on economic development boards and supporting efforts for local businesses, I learned of the barriers they face to sustaining their Wyoming brand! I believe the network that I have built with community leaders across various issues is the best asset I can leverage as I advocate for my constituents at the legislature.\r\n",
      "It’s hard to say, the political climate at the legislature has been pretty chaotic. Even bills from the interim sessions that had hours upon hours of public testimony were not introduced for discussion. I question any candidate who makes promises of how they will address anything next year. \r\n\r\nFor my part, I’m committed to serving as a pragmatic voice of reason that is focused on finding solutions to real Wyoming issues. Some of our biggest challenges have been plaquing Wyoming for generations and we are starting to feel the heavy toll of legislators’ negligence and inaction. For decades Wyoming has known of the alarming rate that younger generations leave the state and do not come back. Now as we struggle to sustain childcare, assisted living centers, maternal care providers, and more, the generations that left and did not come back are the working professionals that we need for our elders and the generations on the way. Deregulate, incentivize, seed-fund… we just need a solution.\r\n",
      "The amount of micromanaging by some legislators this year was awful, especially considering how vague, irrelevant, and unclear some of the bills were that got passed. Sound governance is dependent on a division of labor and respect for the role that each governing body plays in the state.\r\n\r\nWyomingites can best access the decision makers that are closest to home where decisions are certainly made faster than at the legislature that only meets at the beginning of the year. Whether it's the decisions that are happening at their local county commissioners meeting, or the decisions being made between them and their doctors or teachers, etc. local control allows citizens the greatest freedom and flexibility and ensures policies can meet the unique needs of each community.\r\n\r\nLocal control should not be treated as a free pass for the state to kick the can. Our constitution defines several decisions as the responsibility of the state. In those instances we should strive to be locally-informed.",
      "\r\nThe state has a constitutional obligation to support the well-being of Wyoming citizens and their families in many of these areas and a moral obligation to be a part of finding a solution. Another consideration is what is the long term cost if we don’t support their well-being? Two of the particular concerns I had from this year were, legislators who celebrated budget cuts for the sake of cuts, and the rampant crying wolf when they simply didn’t understand or read a bill. When simple error corrections to a behavioral health bill passed in 2021 came up some voted against it despite the fact it would save $50 million dollars over a decade. When told about the impact of the Hathaway Scholarship and that it has never been increased since first created decades ago, some voted against even a discussion. This narrow minded savings without a plan is simply hoarding. Should any of these issues be neglected for long, the expense to the state will far outpace any interest earnings from reserves.",
      "I’m willing to collaborate and work with anyone who is seeking to address the needs of Wyoming citizens. I’m not tied to any national platform or purity tests, I’m only tied to the constituents of my district. Through conversation with neighbors throughout the district there has been a significant number of folks who just want the legislature to knock off the antics and get to work.\r\n\r\nDuring last year’s budget session there were several proposals for how the state might address property taxes but much of the behind the scenes debate was not on the substance of the bill, it was about the name and political affiliation of each bill’s sponsor. These are the very antics that don’t serve our community and keep us from passing sound and effective policies that provide relief when it is needed.\r\n",
      "We have valuable minerals within Wyoming’s beautiful landscapes and the open spaces that are desirable for energy development, but… we also have a constitutional duty to manage wildlife issues and to preserve the opportunity to hunt and fish in Wyoming, and I don’t think we want to find ourselves in a position where development undermines the very things that made it beautiful to live here in the first place.\r\n\r\nMany projects are on private lands, but for those on state lands, I believe we must be reasonable and responsible in how we lease these lands and it is the role of the state to determine what those criteria are. I was surprised by the thought of removing public comment periods which would have undermined local control and perspective. Perspective that was clearly missing when a lease in Casper was initially awarded.\r\n"

I have 45 years of experience working in the energy industry, primarily in natural gas. I've experienced addressing regulatory actions with these agencies' EPA, WDEQ, OSHA, DOT, and sub-branches.\r\nI've spent years addressing public land access issues and have participated in many federal land management planning efforts. I'm also no stranger to agriculture issues, with friends and relatives who farm and ranch in Wyoming and South Dakota.\r\nI've been an active member of the Natrona County Republican party since 2008, serving as Precinct Committeeman, NCGOP State Committeeman, and the Natrona County GOP Executive Committee member.\r\nI served on the Wyoming State Trails Advisory Council and Black Hills NF Travel Management Subcommittee.

      "The focus of my campaign has been on the citizens in my district. They have widely expressed concerns about property tax reform for all, distrust of government institutions, inflation, threats to their Constitutional rights, a two-tiered justice system, and the very real sense that Americans have become second-class citizens compared to those entering the country illegally. Many of their concerns were initiated by federal actions, but states have an obligation to address their concerns.  ",
      "Local control is a key component in good governance, but it is the nature of all government to exert an increasingly heavy hand. Local government is as capable of stepping on your rights as state and federal authorities. I'm confident that constituents will let me know when a jurisdiction has exceeded it mandate.  ",
      "A half-century of government meddling in all these categories has only amplified the problems. As a prosperous nation, we can help the least fortunate without mandating it. We are the most charitable population on the planet, and it's not even close. I think the \"state\" has already done enough damage to the \"well-being\" of Wyoming families and every other family in America. Wyoming, like every other state, should refrain from collective thinking on what's best for families   ",
      "I believe conservative principles, properly applied, result in the best governance with the least imposition on the citizen. I think all government suffers from a form of Parkinson's Law of Expansion  - the bureaucracy exists because the maintenance of these institutions exceed the missions for which they were created.\r\nI make compromises at work everyday, but not to the point it can put someone in jeopardy or fails to produce the desired result.\r\nThe same is true for public policy.  but you better bring a solid argument with receipts.",
      "I would not describe this as a balancing act. A better question might be \"Can we maintain a healthy environment for economic activity and wildlife?\" Outside the issue of CWD, which I don't possess any expertise in, I would say we have been successful in doing that for several decades. \r\nRecent elk population surveys indicate the highest numbers in a decade, despite the growing economic footprint. Large predators have also expanded their territory, not just in Wyoming, but even eastward.\r\nOpen spaces is different from wildlife, and viewsheds are not what they were in Wyoming fifteen years ago. I am not enthusiastic about another thousand plus wind turbines scattered across our horizons. Oil and gas infrastructure is not comparable to the visual degradation that wind farms provide. I'm very interested in seeing what remains behind as some of these locations are decommissioned. "

      "72",
      "My name is Carmen Whitehead and I've lived in Green River Wyoming for 44 years. My husband and I raised our three sons here. I am the daughter of a Sunrise, Wyoming iron ore miner and a stay at home mom. My dad helped organize a union at the C F and I (Colorado Fuel & Iron) mine which improved the lives of the miners. I graduated from Torrington Senior High School and received an A.A.S. degree in Office Information Systems from WWCC (Western Wyoming Community College). Locally, I have worked in the Third Judicial District Court and then transferred to the Engineering, Planning and Zoning Department. I was a Democrat delegate twice at the state's conventions. For quite some time, I have followed the politics both locally and nationally and have concerns about the direction that Wyoming seems to be taking. Therefore, I decided to become more involved.",
      "Wyoming does not have a broad home rule for municipalities, meaning that local governments often need state authorization to exercise certain powers. As a state legislator, I would need to identify areas where local governments need more autonomy or state guidance.",
      "Local governments are generally better suited to address issues that directly affect the day-to-day lives of their communities. This would include issues like property zoning, development permits, and local land use because local governments understand the specific needs and geography of their communities. Local governments usually have an intimate knowledge of the infrastructure and public services required by their population and are often involved in decisions about local roads, utilities, parks, and recreational facilities. Public safety laws are set at the state level, however, the administration and operation of local police and fire departments are handled at the municipal level with local ordinances regulating specifics. Although Wyoming's school system is regulated by state law, school boards and local districts have authority over daily administration, policies, and local tax levies.\r\n",
      "One state issue is Wyoming's natural resource management. Wyoming's economy and environment are heavily tied to natural resources. Also public health regulations and healthcare systems benefit from state level oversight on issues like Medicaid, mental health services and responses to statewide emergencies. I also believe that the state should support a woman's autonomy to make their own healthcare decisions without government overreach. While local governments can raise revenue through local sales taxes or bonds, the state legislature controls most aspects of taxation, (ie., property taxes, income tax, severance taxes, and corporate taxes) ensuring a coherent statewide fiscal policy. Large scale economic initiatives, such as attracting new industries or regulating energy production, often require state level coordination to create a favorable business climate and regulate industry operations. \r\n",
      "In Wyoming, the balance between state and local legislation is shaped by constitutional principles, practical governance and the unique needs of both local communities and the state has a whole. \r\nAs a state legislator, my role would be to ensure statewide issues receive the oversight they need while empowering local governments to address community specific concerns. My evaluating each issue based on jurisdiction, resources and impact, I would be able to make informed decisions about when to legislate at the state level and when to leave it to local authorities. By being an informed legislator, this would help me to converse with those who have differing views. \r\n",
      "Balancing competing interests for public lands is a complex issue. Hunters and recreationalists want to see open roads and open access; and mineral development, whether it's oil or trona or coal, all compete for the same areas. We also need to protect wildlife migration corridors and habitats and historical sites like Adobe Town yet be able to allow mining in less critical wildlife areas while keeping spaces open for public land. We need to bring all parties involved together to reach a consensus. Not everyone will get everything they want, but we need to protect all parties."

This however does become more difficult when we discuss housing in the state of Wyoming. We are currently in a housing shortage in some of the more populous areas of Wyoming causing housing costs to skyrocket. So an honest discussion does need to take place in relation to building more housing while still respecting these natural areas we still use for recreation."

      "Wildlife populations predate human settlement, and I believe it is humanity's responsibility to be good stewards of our wildlife populations. Beyond the obvious ecological benefits, there are significant economic considerations as well. Wyoming families often use more resources than they contribute to the economy. As a state, we should aim for sustainable, slow population growth that emphasizes private property rights and protects our natural integrity. This approach ensures that we preserve our natural landscapes and wildlife while supporting a balanced and sustainable economic development.\r\n"

He also has first hand knowledge of the role production agriculture plays in responsible energy development.",
      "We are living in a dynamic time in energy production. Wyoming can and should be a national leader in energy innovation, but we should put just as much effort into examining how our regulatory and tax structure make it harder to currently produce energy in our state. We need to be honest about the effects state level decisions - such as a large severance, sales and property tax burdens - have on our oil, gas and coal industries.  \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the state should provide an even playing field in the evolving area of hydrogen production, which can be produced with either natural gas or water. The state currently has a double standard by levying a severance tax against natural gas but not water used for hydrogen production.  We should also adjust our severance tax rate to stabilize revenues which are affected by the federal decision to increase royalty rates for oil and gas.",
      "Wyoming has a problem with too much state micromanagement of local entities. This is especially true in K-12 education. We need to let go of the notion that all revenue and capitol construction decisions for our school districts should be made by the legislature. Wyoming is home to a diverse group of communities and this one-size-fits all, top-down approach has clearly failed to produce results consistent with the extraordinary amount of taxpayer dollars devoted to our government schools. \r\n\r\nI will continue advocating for incorporating both local control and new revenue sources into the school capitol construction process.  Also, providing more school choice options prioritizes students over systems and empowers the most local of decision makers - the parents and guardians of our students.",
      "The state should focus on providing consistent services to our citizens.  By overspending when we have a surplus, the legislature increases the chances of cuts when we are short of funds.  This lack of fiscal discipline exacerbates our boom and bust cycles. I will continue to support inflation based increases in our budget, but am also open to cuts in some areas after a significant increase in our spending this past budget session.",
      "I am a conservative Republican who understands our political processes, especially the legislative process, are ones of moderation. I have a successful track record of bringing together groups with diverse interests to agree on a mutual path forward. ",
      "As a rancher in an energy rich area, I routinely balance oil, gas and wind development with the long term preservation of the natural resources my family depends on for our livelihood.  These efforts also protect wildlife and open spaces. While this takes some effort, it is a balance Wyoming ranchers and the state as a whole have routinely stuck for decades.  Real estate development has a much larger and more permanent impact on our open spaces.  Conservation easements and wildlife crossings are tools we should continue to use to preserve key habitat from development that would negatively impact our wildlife and open spaces."

Recognizing that Wyoming is often referred to as one small town with long streets, this reference can miss the unique challenges our diverse communities face: Campbell County is blessed with mineral wealth, Teton County experiences extraordinary tourism, Albany County has the University and each of our communities is both blessed and challenged in ways that their neighbors are not.

      "Graduated from UW, became a pilot with USAF.  Flew for United Airlines for 30 years.  While on furlough from UAL went on active duty for the Navy.  My wife and I opened a hardware store in Douglas in 1989 with my parents.  My wife and I opened an ACE  Hardware in Wheatland in 2002 and in 2013 we moved to Wheatland to operate the store full time.  Sold the business last year and can no longer sit in the sidelines and watch what is happenong to our country and state.  I am a very conservative guy.",
      "Taxes - There was a citizen petition with great possibilities that we didn't get enough signatures on last year.  There was a bill in the legislature last year that wound have rolled the home valuations back to pre covid values and limited increases to 3%.  We need to try again.\r\nCO2 - The coming Ice Age didn't work,  the coming world desert didn't work, now we have Climate Change which is another talking point for the liberals to gain more control over your lives.\r\nThe Governor wants to make Wyoming carbon negative.  That plant will only cost 3 - 6 Billion dollars and it will reduce the carbon dioxide (not Monoxide) levels which will be detrimental to plant life and crop production.\r\nWe need to take back \"States Rights\" .  We have all the natural resources the country needs to be energy independent again right here in this state.  Lets use them.\r\nWe don't need to be another welcoming state for illegals.  If you are here illegally get out.",

      "Economic development is the tide that raises all ships.  People leave all small communities to shop in a larger community.  With them go the tax dollars to support much of where they live.  In some cases they say they can't find it at home but they didn't look.  Sadly covid was good for small business because people had to stay home.  I had customers say wow, you have a lot of stuff in here, but after covid they were back to Cheyenne.  The State needs to encourage and promote economic development.  Depending on the business, some tax breaks, assistance in land acquisition.  The breaks should not be for more than 5 years      (3-5) which is about how long it takes to become profitable  But we also need to try and educate people to try to shop locally as well",

Between the two degrees, I served as a 2LT in the US Army (Engineers).  I finished my military career in the Reserves.  The majority of my professional career was in upstream oil and gas exploration and production and I am a registered Professional Engineer in both Wyoming and Texas (now ‘inactive’).  Upon retirement, I assumed full operational control of my farm which was leased out to a very good neighbor while I was working in O&G.

I served one term as a Platte County Commissioner where I worked to secure funding for infrastructure projects in Platte County and its municipalities.",
      "I see the biggest challenge facing Wyoming today as the erosion of the revenue stream from our legacy energy industries and I will fight to protect these industries.  Without a strong revenue stream our state cannot maintain the services and educational opportunities that we are accustomed to.  I will look for opportunities to leverage other states’ green mandates to our advantage in order to maintain our coal and NG fired electrical generation facilities.",
      "As a former County Commissioner, it did not sit well when Cheyenne told us to do xyz at an expense to the county without providing funding to execute the order.  The State can supply the guideline and the local government can execute to that guideline.  Was what we were doing acceptable?  Yes.  If the State wants uniformity of a particular service and there are counties that are providing that service outside of the State guideline, then fund the mandate to change.  My approach to local control is that government closest to the people is usually the best government.  I appreciate that there could be some services that the State wants to make uniform for a potential cost advantage, for example, but the State needs to fund the mandate, especially for counties that were using an alternate method.",
      "Without a strong revenue stream, ‘wrestling’ with these issues will not be much of a match.  Thankfully, our state has been able to ‘wrestle’ with these issues BECAUSE we have had strong revenue.  I see education as the primary input factor in providing a rising tide that raises all ships.  An educated populous is the best way through which success can be earned and people are empowered.  Not all students need to go to UW and I strongly support efforts to strengthen Career and Technical education as well as the UW pathway.",
      "As an engineer, a large part of my make-up is task oriented and achieving the objective.  If other legislators do not share my view of ‘the objective’, then I need to spend additional time trying to better explain my version of ‘the objective’.  By no means am I always right but I DO spend time in studying issues.  When not explicitly familiar with how something works, I will seek information from those who ARE familiar with the issue and use the additional data points when making my decision.  Depending on the issue, some percentage of agreement to a not perfect bill can be better than zero percent agreement to a perfect bill.  In the former, at least some of the objective has been achieved compared to the latter where none of the objective was achieved.  I want to move closer to the objective.",
      "Sometimes, I think we do not give wildlife enough credit.  I have seen our pronghorn grazing peacefully on the grass at the Randall Av exit on I-25 in Cheyenne.  This is not to say that industries should have free reign to do anything they want, but more often than not, wildlife figures out what is going on and adapt.  Access to natural water for the wildlife should be protected.  I think the balance is use of common sense.  Drilling a well takes a month (for example) and the wildlife steer clear.  After the rig is gone, human activity is reduced and the wildlife return."

I have served on several committees and boards in our community. I had the opportunity to serve 10 years on the Laramie County School District 2 board of trustees and was able to gain a tremendous amount of insight to how our governing bodies work and how our children are educated.

      "Two of the best ways to promote a prosperous economic environment are to invest in early childhood education and health care. Drawing on my experience in education I think we can make great strides in overcoming these issues by improving the tools we provide our educators as well as changing some of our funding to be more efficient for its intended purpose. With health care we need to encourage more medical professionals to come to Wyoming while developing much needed healthcare facilities and care coordination for our elderly patients. \r\nWe also need to encourage job growth in Wyoming so we can retain our children as they graduate from school. We need to work at getting our minerals and petroleum industry back to normal healthy economic production. We need to continue to grow our tourism industry as it has a tremendous amount of untapped potential that we can share with the world. ",

The state should work to minimize regulations in order to promote a more robust economic climate that will allow for more economic investment from companies that fit the Wyoming culture. The state should also promote good land use regulations and lower property taxes to encourage housing growth. \r\nHealthcare can be addressed by promoting legislation that that support the most effective preventative medicine for both physical and mental health and also support efforts in communication and care coordination for patients. We can build on existing legislation to accomplish some of these things without spending additional funds. \r\nIn education, teachers need to be in the classroom and have the tools to manage and instruct effectively and we should refocus our education dollars to promote student achievement.",
      "As long as the legislators are debating from a position that protects our state’s constitution and the rights of is people I am willing to hear all of the discussion and I will stand on those positions while protecting the culture, heritage, moral and religious beliefs that I share with my constituents. ",
      "Having worked for the Wyoming Game and Fish Department and understanding our migration patterns and crucial winter range I would rely heavily on the information provided by wildlife officials to minimize any impacts that big development would have on the sustainability of Wyomings wildlife. Our second largest industry in Wyoming is tourism and our wildlife play a vital role in the success and future of that industry. Wyoming is growing and our state should help facilitate that growth through better land use regulations and updated water and waste management regulations in order to slow the sprawl surrounding our communities. We are currently consuming enormous amounts of habitat and ranch land to build sprawling subdivisions due to inadequate regulations around our biggest population centers. We need to review these regulations and work with DEQ and the State Engineers office to support a more responsible growth patterns for our communities and a more efficient use of resources."

As a lobbyist for the League of Women Voters, I have been an advocate for free and fair elections. I am known for working with diverse groups to seek practical solutions to real problems. In 2006, I wrote a 400-page guide to state government, A Look at Wyoming Government. I hold master’s degrees in education and journalism.\r\nI have been a business owner and have been active in many organizations, including Wyoming State Board of Nursing, Wyoming Children’s Trust Fund, League of Women Voters, Cheyenne Schools Foundation, COMEA (homeless shelter), Wyoming Breastfeeding Coalition, Wyoming Girls State, Wyoming High School Mock Trial, St. Mary’s Cathedral music and Hispanic Organization for Progress and Education (HOPE). \r\n\r\n",

I defer to local voters who elect and empower local governing bodies to understand local needs and act accordingly. \r\nExamples? I disagreed with the Legislature's decision to take charter school approval away from local districts. I strongly support local school districts' authority to write curriculum and to budget their block grant funding to fit local needs.

Sometimes solutions may require changes in state law and regulations, too. \r\nLegislative and executive branches of our government definitely have a role in advancing the well-being of Wyoming people. I have heard that self-reliance will solve every problem. It definitely is a strong factor. I also know that the whole state benefits when families who struggle (for various reasons) are helped to succeed with resources the state can provide or coordinate. The state can help local initiatives succeed and can conduct its own programs.\r\nI want to support individuals and families and will work with officials to provide the accountability they require, to the benefit of the whole state.",

I also will appreciate better understanding of issues by conversation with those of different opinions.\r\nThese are lessons I have learned in 40-plus years of observing and advocating  in the Wyoming Capitol. \r\n\r\n",
      "The first step is recognizing the importance of all those factors to the diverse people of Wyoming and to our state's future. We cannot begin by insisting that one of those interests must trump the others in all cases. My friend Steff Kessler wrote about \"the Wyoming way\" of finding balance, using existing regulations, taking a case-by-case analysis and always building on broad consensus that we value all of those things: development AND wildlife/open spaces. \r\nWe can identify spaces necessary to conserve wildlife habitat (including migration corridors) and at the same time acknowledge development essential to take care of our people and accommodate development essential to our economy. You also must consider the various management requirements for various federal and state lands. Within that framework, we can find accommodations for all essential needs.\r\nIt's necessary to see the whole state and all its interests in every decision. \r\nAs Kessler wrote, \"It's hard work but we can do it.\"\r\n\r\n"

My experiences included managing a workforce of more than 30 employees, marketing, budgeting, permitting, preparing tax returns, and more. In recent years I've served on boards for a variety of organizations and non-profits. I've advocated on many issues at the state and local level. I have an empathetic personality and I'm a good listener. Those traits help me to find commonality with others. As the Wyoming Senator for District 10, I will be diligent in my efforts to find solutions to the many challenges we face in Wyoming.",
      "Most importantly, I will acknowledge those problems and look for the opportunities that lie within them. Too many of our legislators have not faced up to the very real challenges that are in our path. I plan to be active on whatever interim committees I am assigned. I'm willing to work hard, study, and think outside the box to find solutions and common ground. Making our communities stronger, more resilient, and adaptable is critical to their chances of long term health and success. I believe the experience and problem-solving skills I've developed will be valuable in the Wyoming Legislature.",
      "As much as possible and constitutional, people across Wyoming should have control of their own communities. The Wyoming Legislature should not dictate to local jurisdictions. The legislature has a poor record when they have assumed this power. Even when they believe they have a community's best interests at heart, the unintended consequences of their actions are often detrimental. The Wyoming and U.S. Constitutions should be our guide.",
      "It is important for our state to create a welcoming atmosphere for the people living here and those we wish to attract, rather than push extremist policies that do the opposite. The legislature must take a comprehensive look at our education funding model, housing solutions, and healthcare, all of which impact economic development. The legislature has neglected its responsibility in regards to the health and well-being of our citizens for far too long. The legislature must pass Medicaid Expansion in the next session. As a state, we should work to make healthcare and health insurance more affordable, and more universally available.",
      "Our only hope lies in being able to find common ground and being willing to work for the betterment of everyone in Wyoming. I am willing to listen and to negotiate. While there are issues we will never agree on, there is still much good that can be accomplished. Animosity will only short-circuit any attempts to achieve that good. I believe I can work with those who feel the same.",
      "Every proposal for development should be judged on its own merits, but also in its overall impact both on our economy and our wildlife and open spaces. Our state is so large that, with a conscientious effort, I believe we can \"have it all.\" Our tourism and outdoor recreation industries are growing and vital segments of our economy and we can't endanger them with reckless development."

      "I live on Hidden Valley Road between Riverton and Shoshoni.  I moved here in 1994 from Lysite. I have lived in Wyoming since for 65 years and I was born in Riverton.",
      "I will be 66 years old on Election Day.",
      "I was raised by my parents John and Ann Philp at Lysite, Wyoming where my family owns a ranch. I grew up with my siblings Frank, Diana, Rob and Dorothy. We worked together on the ranch and had a good upbringing taking care of the sheep and cattle. I started school and graduated from Shoshoni, Casper College and the University of Wyoming (BS Ag Business '81.) I returned to work on the ranch after college. I participated in the Wyoming LEAD Program for leadership development for Agriculture.  I was on the steering committee for Project Learning Tree, a science-based curriculum for all school grades.  I'm a member of the Wyoming Wool Growers and Stock Growers Associations. I am a lifelong conservative Republican, serving as a Precinct Committee Woman and in 2023 I was elected State Committee Woman for Fremont County. I have volunteered as a First Responder.  I am married to Jerry Dilts, a retired rancher. We own a small farm and raise a few cattle in Hidden Valley. ",
      "The biggest challenge lawmakers face is passing a balanced budget that prioritizes state and local government as laid out in the Wyoming Constitution.  The state's tax structure is such that the oil and gas industries fund 50% of the state's revenue. This amounts to $4000 for every man, woman and child in Wyoming. The legislature should be cognizant of the imbalance and at least work to not expand the disparity.  \r\n\r\nWyoming provides educational opportunities to students so they will contribute to the overall economy when they enter the workforce. Their skills and professions are in demand and much needed to move our state forward. \r\n\r\n",
      "Local control should be respected by the legislature because government closest to the people serves the people best. This is the case for local county boards appointed by the county commissioners and various elected boards such as city councils, school, county fire, cemetery and conservation districts.",
      "The state's role in supporting the well-being of the citizens and their families is to provide avenues for education so that when young men and women enter the workforce, they can earn a livable wage and succeed in their profession or vocation. It is important that people are able to work at jobs that provide health insurance, so they have access to health care. For housing, there are federal programs for first time home buyers that qualify for home loans at reduced interest rates. In Riverton, there is a local board at the REACH Foundation which works with federal programs to provide affordable low income and senior housing and care for elderly in an assisted living facility. The state does provide women's health screening for qualifying applicants because early detection is important for treating diseases successfully.",
      "I will be civil and work with others to solve problems for the best interest of the state.  That is Wyoming issues, not arguing national talking points and rhetoric. ",
      "Wyoming has always worked to preserve its wildlife populations.  The state has primacy over its migration corridors for deer and antelope in Western Wyoming.  It also has staved off listing the Sage Grouse as endangered by managing habitat to maintain populations.\r\nWyoming's large ranches are great for wildlife, few people and predator control benefit wildlife. There are voluntary land trusts that preserve working ranches for future generations in conservation easements.  I do not believe that energy development nor industry competes for very much of wildlife habitat because there are siting requirements in the permitting process to protect wildlife.  Real estate development can be mitigated with denser housing plats rather than large 20 or 40 acre tracts.  "

      "I currently live at the headquarters of the family Two Bar Ranch. The mailing address is 13900 State Highway 487, Casper, WY 82604. The physical location is 23 highway miles SW of Casper. I have lived here since 1974. \r\n\r\nI was born at a U.S. Marine Corps base in Klamath Falls, Oregon. My father, Dr.Oliver K. Scott, MD, was in the Navy in WW II and was assigned to that base as part of the medical team treating marines returning from the South Pacific with tropical diseases. I was moved to Casper in 1948 at the age of 3 when my father became Casper's first pediatrician. I went out of state for education and worked 5 years for the federal government in Washington D.C., but always maintained a Wyoming residency. \r\n",
      "79. Assuming reelection, I will be the only Senator at the 2025 session over the age of 75. The legislature is a representative body and it helps to have a member who is personally experiencing the special circumstance of our older population. ",
      "Education: BA Harvard College, MBA Harvard Business School, designated a George F. Baker Scholar (top 5% of class). My first job after graduation was an operations research analyst in Washington, D.C. I have maintained those skills and found them very useful as a member of the Wyoming Legislature. \r\nPrincipal Occupation: Cattle Rancher. In 1971 my family bought a very run down ranch. I came back to Wyoming to run it in 1974 and was joined by my brother a couple of years later. Restoring the ranch to profitable productivity has been a very satisfying life work. I have met the test of success in our private free enterprise system. \r\n\r\nWyoming Legislature: I served two terms in the Wyoming House of Representatives and then moved to the Senate starting in 1983. My most important achievement has been that I sponsored the bill that established the Hathaway scholarships that average students can earn to help finance their attendance at the University of Wyoming or our community colleges. I have sponsored 71 bills that have become law, been a cosponsor on numerous others. I have been a principal in many successful committee sponsored reform efforts including the Worker's Comp and Welfare reforms. \r\n",
      "The key is to get our budget and financial systems right. Our basic services need to be well funded so we do a good job providing them. These include education from kindergarten through the University, health services for those who cannot afford them including mental health, developmental disabilities, and nursing home/in home care for the elderly, the highway system, environmental protection, game and fish regulation and help for cities and counties who among other duties provide police, fire and first response services. Our tax revenues have big ups and downs so we need major spendable reserves. We should continue building our permanent funds so we will have adequate revenue when our minerals are either used up or locked up by the federal government. \r\n\r\nCurrently many families are being hurt by the rapid rise in property taxes caused by the current real estate valuation inflation. We need to enact a 25% homeowner's property tax relief, about the same size as the one the Governor vetoed after the last session. With our current spending policies we can afford this kind of tax relief. We need to build a coalition with enough votes to override a second veto.\r\n",
      "The general rule should be to favor local control. Better decisions are made if local circumstances are considered. Two exceptions. Sometimes a uniform state rule will make private businesses more efficient saving us all money. Second, local bureaucracies can fail to provide effective services as is currently true in education. Wyoming got professional advice from our consultants that students who tested basic or below basic on our reading assessment test could not read well enough to participate in the modern high tech economy. This was 45% of students before COVID and 52% after. Third grade reading was used because education after third grade assumes the child can read at grade level. There are big differences in results by school district; only a third of districts do well. The problem is not teachers who are uniformly good across the state. The problem is the competence and motivation of local district administrators. If the local priority is building a bureaucratic or sports empire, the basics of teaching reading can be neglected. We need to create statewide incentives that will force poorly performing districts to reform. They can if nothing else they can imitate the successful districts. \r\n",
      "The state should spend enough so our basic governmental services are well done. The state appropriately provides partial funding for amenities- fine and performing arts, outdoor recreation, etc. Wyoming is not building enough housing to meet the needs of young families. To keep housing costs down we need to reduce the regulatory burden and provide more of the needed infrastructure. The government should avoid directly building housing. We need to strengthen our entire education system. A good education system is one of the best economic development tools. A good local health care system is very important. Hospitals should be locally owned. Hospital chains are likely to move too much of our health care to their facilities in other states. Where the mistake of selling the hospital has been made the state needs to help fix the consequences. I am skeptical of efforts to buy economic development with subsidies and loans. A better strategy focuses on good essential government services, low taxes and keeping the regulatory burden reasonable and limited to what's important. ",
      "The art of compromise is the art of good legislation. The divided system of government that our founding fathers gave us is designed to force compromise. With the diversity of interests and opinions present in our free society our founders were very wise in this design. It has the benefit of producing legislation that most of society can live with most of the time. There will be a few times a legislator ought to stand on principle and say we have to do this or not do that, but one that takes this attitude too often will be ineffective. It is best done when there is a constitutional issue the courts are likely to enforce. The fact I have had as much legislative success as I have shows I know how to work with others to reach compromises with broad support. ",
      "In general our system is currently doing a relatively good job of balancing these issues. There will always be debates over specific issues. For example, I oppose the proposed Coates Road gravel pit. It hurts too many people. Access to public lands is becoming a major issue. In the Muddy Mountain elk hunt area the state land in Deer Creek Park is good elk habitat. A wealthy individual has bought all the access and has been excluding the public. The elk go there for hunting season so the Game & Fish has lost control of that herd. This has become too common in the eastern half of Wyoming where there is more private land. We are going to have to deal with this problem legislatively. The Constitution lets us force sale of a right of way for a public road to reach the public land. We may have to create a fund to do just this if reasonable compromises on this issue cannot be reached. "

By prioritizing these areas, Wyoming can create a strong foundation for the well-being and prosperity of its citizens and their families, ensuring a vibrant future for the state.",
      "I am generally open to compromise with legislators and officials who hold different perspectives, provided discussions remain rational and respectful.

      "Immigration impacts Wyoming by contributing to its economy through labor in agriculture, energy, and tourism sectors. It also enriches cultural diversity and helps address workforce shortages. Congress can improve immigration policy for Wyoming by implementing reforms such as: Creating visa programs tailored to Wyoming's specific labor shortages in agriculture, energy extraction, and hospitality.  Establishing clear paths to legal status for undocumented immigrants already contributing to Wyoming's economy. Streamlining processes to reunite families, supporting stable communities. Enhancing border security while ensuring efficient processes for legal immigration. Investing in programs that facilitate immigrants' integration, including language and job training. By addressing these aspects, Congress can create policies that benefit Wyoming citizens by supporting its economy and communities while respecting immigrant contributions and the rule of law.",
      "I strongly support federal legislation that upholds the right to legal and safe abortions. Ensuring access to abortion services is crucial for women's health, autonomy, and equality. Restricting access jeopardizes reproductive rights and can lead to unsafe practices. Federal legislation should protect these rights nationwide, ensuring consistency and equity regardless of state laws. Similarly, access to contraceptives is essential for reproductive health and family planning. Federal policies should guarantee affordable and widespread availability of contraceptives, including education on their use. This supports individual choice, reduces unintended pregnancies, and promotes overall public health. In summary, I advocate for federal legislation that protects and expands access to both abortions and contraceptives, affirming individuals' rights to make informed decisions about their reproductive health.",
      "Balancing wildlife preservation and open spaces with energy, industrial, and real estate development in Wyoming demands careful planning. Establishing protected areas and wildlife corridors preserves native habitats through zoning laws and conservation easements. Promoting sustainable energy like wind and solar supports growth while minimizing environmental impact. Engaging stakeholders—environmentalists, developers, indigenous communities, and government—ensures collaboration and diverse perspectives. Enforcing regulations with impact assessments ensures development meets environmental standards. Integrating conservation and responsible development sustains Wyoming's natural heritage and economic vitality."

      "We need to emphasize the use of fossil fuels and eliminate any new construction of nuclear power plants until after there is a permanent site for nuclear waste.  I would propose a national moratorium on new nuclear construction, while also working behind the scenes with Wyoming legislators, seeking to make Wyoming the 13th state with a state moratorium, prohibiting the construction of new nuclear power plants until after there is a permanent site for nuclear waste.   Fossil fuels are becoming more and more efficient and clean, with new technologies, such as carbon capturing, making the use of fossil fuels more and more desirable.  Joe Biden, who I think is the worst and most anti-American president ever, wants rapid expansion of civil nuclear power in the United States. He cannot and should not be trusted.  Wyoming must not be a party to the internal nuclear poisoning.  ",
      "The appointment of good people to manage federal lands is critical.  Investing in landscape preservation, instead of nuclear energy, along with good management of the lands, creates natural carbon storage and maintains  and protects our clean water.  We all enjoy the benefits of clean air and water.   Good management also benefits wildlife and their habitats.",
      "Wyoming should assist families to only a limited degree, while requiring all able-bodied men to work as part of any assistance program.   One exception where expansion would make sense is for mental health services.  Mental health issues appear rampant and contribute to other issues affecting the well being of citizens and their families. \nLiving with the fear of radiation exposure will increase if Kemmerer has a nuclear power plant.  The experimental nuclear plant proposed for Kemmerer has a life expectancy of 60 years.  The environment minister in Germany, which shut down its last nuclear reactor in 2023, has stated 3 generations of Germans benefited from nuclear power and now about 30,000 generations would be faced with dealing with the radioactive nuclear waste.  Wyoming would be well supporting its citizens if it were to pass a statewide moratorium against new construction of nuclear power plants until there was first a permanent storage site for highly radioactive nuclear waste. ",
      "My willingness to compromise is dependent on the issue.  As stated above, I have resolved hundreds of disputes and resolution of disputes generally requires compromise.  On the other hand, burdening Wyoming for hundreds and thousands of years with nuclear waste, with no permanent site for the storage of nuclear waste, would not be something I would likely compromise on.  The federal government has promised a permanent nuclear waste site for at least 60 years and there are no foreseeable plans to provide a permanent storage site.  No one wants it.  Nuclear is not needed and most climate change advocates do not want nuclear power, which they know is fraught with danger and is not environmentally sustainable, in addition to being very expensive.  Wyoming must not trust Joe Biden with its future.  If Wyoming is willing to burden hundreds of future generations with the problem of dealing with nuclear waste, we should all hang our heads in shame. ",
      "We need the remain in Mexico policy to be in place.  We need to enforce our current immigration laws.  We should close our border and reverse Joe Biden's open border policy.  A country without borders will not be a country for long, as terrorists and criminals are included in the persons illegally entering this country.  ",
      "I would support federal legislation restricting abortions.  I think it is necessary to slow down the slaughter of unborn children.  I oppose any contraceptives that kill a baby after conception but approve of contraceptives that prevent fertilization of the mother's egg.",
      "This needs to be addressed on a case-by-case basis.  I think \"balance\" is the key, as developing our fossil fuels is essential to the economy of Wyoming.  In addition, tourism, hunting,  fishing, and outdoor activities are also essential to Wyoming's economy.  We have clean air and clean water.  We have pristine areas that must be protected.  We have a wonderful life living in Wyoming and we must not put it all at risk by allowing the construction of an experimental nuclear power plant in Kemmerer.  We must not let our greed for money put the safety of future generations at risk, likely for thousands and thousands of years.  Jesus was walking on this planet about 2,000 years ago.  I think he would want us to protect our planet and to love our neighbors.  We must not trust Joe Biden and we must \"fight like Helling\" against the construction of an experimental nuclear power plant in Kemmerer. "

A strong advocate of workers since 1978, as an EEOC, MSPB, unemployment hearings, SSDI appeals, ADA rep, President of the ninth largest local American Postal Workers Union (APWU) in the nation and later the Director of Industrial Relations.  Currently serves as the President of the Denver Metro Retiree Chapter chartered by APWU.  The chapter has members all over the country, including Wyoming.  In his pro bono occupations, literally hundreds of calls, letters and emails have been made to Senator Barrasso's office to advocate for his current constituents.  This Senator votes 100% of the time against workers, unions, women, equality, democracy and the poor.  That is why I was compelled to run.",
      "First of all, we need all of our congressional delegation from Wyoming to adhere to the principles of the \"equality\" state.  Codifying the fantastic principles of decency and fairness to all, including women, in the same manner as the Great State of Wyoming should be a top priority.  Women should have equal health care opportunities, equal pay at work,  equal employment and business opportunities, etc.  Therefore, the Equal Rights amendment consistently voted against by our current federal delegation must be a priority to get passed.    Making Medicaid expansion more palatable for legislatures like Wyoming is mandatory to insure all people including children have access to health care in Wyoming.   I fully support and would co-sponsor S-597, HR 82, HR 1447, HR 5569, HR 5601, HR 6992, and HR 884, when they have sister bills in the US Senate. Any legislation to adhere to Matthew 25, 41-46 will be a priority for me.\n",
      "I don't.  The current BLM administration is transparent, efficient and protects OUR lands from greedy monopolies and politicians.",
      "1.  Pass Medicaid expansion.  \n2.  Instead of putting a billion dollars in a rainy day fund, provide relief for first time home buyers. \n3.  Pay teachers properly and allow greater access to teacher unions.  STOP banning books.  Greater supplementation of UW to lower tuition costs.  \n4.  Starting with Family Farmers and Ranchers, provide them the desperate help they need.  Restrict the percentage of factory farms.\n5.  Accept federal funds paid for by Wyoming tax payers to feed children a nutritious school lunch in lieu of arbitrarily passing on this program.  Lower-income families with school-age kids can get help from the federal government paying for groceries this summer, unless they live in Wyoming.  Increase the minimum wage!",
      "Very.  I need to know what the electorate in Wyoming expects from their Senator and to represent accordingly, even when I may disagree.  As an election worker in Wyoming, it was imperative to work with my colleagues from across the isle.  In 2010 this was a pleasant learning experience for me.  In 2022 it became much more of a challenge.",
      "This is really a non issue.  I just have not seen many immigrants around here and the folks I have seen where the ones who would work on a hot roof when no one else wanted to.",
      "Absolutely NOT.  Any such support would put me at odds with the people of Wyoming's constitution in article one, section 38.  Women's reproductive health care is health care and no one, especially federal reps should be or legally can be,  getting between women and their doctors in family planning.  I support codifying the principles in Roe V Wade.",
      "For the most part that balance has already been achieved.  The balance is tipped a bit by allowing monopolies who egregiously pollute our air and water to run rampant over our lands."
